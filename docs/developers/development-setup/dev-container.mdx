## Using Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code

The project includes a dev container configuration that allows you to use Visual Studio Code's [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension to develop the project in a consistent environment. This can be especially helpful if you are new to the project or if you have a different environment setup on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the dev container, you will need to install the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension for Visual Studio Code.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Using the Dev Container

To use the dev container for the Ensemble project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Ensemble repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `> Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
4. Run `npm start`.
5. The backend will run at `localhost:3000` and the frontend will run at `localhost:4200`.

<Note>
  By default, the development setup only builds specific pieces.Open the file
  `packages/server/api/.env` and add comma-separated list of pieces to make
  available.

For more details, check out the [Piece Development](/developers/development-setup/getting-started) section.

The login credentials are:  
Email: `dev@ap.com`
Password: `12345678`

## Exiting the Dev Container

To exit the dev container and return to your local environment, follow these steps:

1. In the bottom left corner of Visual Studio Code, click the `Remote-Containers: Reopen folder locally` button.
2. Visual Studio Code will close the connection to the dev container and reopen the project in your local environment.

## Troubleshoot

One of the best trouble shoot after an error occur is to reset the dev container.

1. Exit the dev container
2. Run the following
   ```sh
   sh tools/reset-dev.sh
   ```
3. Rebuild the dev container from above steps
