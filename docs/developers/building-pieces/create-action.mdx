This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a Hacker News piece with an action that fetches the top stories. It assumes that you are familiar with the following:

- [Activepieces Repo Structure](../architecture/repo-structure)
- [Activepieces Local development](../development-setup/local) Or [Github Codespaces](../development-setup/codespaces).
- TypeScript syntax.

HackerNews is a social news website that allows users to submit and vote on stories related to computer science and entrepreneurship.

## Piece Definition

To get started, let's generate a new piece for Hacker News

```bash
npm run create-piece hacker-news
```

The piece will be generated at `packages/pieces/hacker-news/`,
the `src/index.ts` file should contain the following code

<Tip>
  This piece doesn't require authentication, check the Authentication Reference
  for more information.
</Tip>

```ts
import { PieceAuth, createPiece } from '@activepieces/pieces-framework';

export const hackerNews = createPiece({
  displayName: 'hacker-news',
  logoUrl: 'https://cdn.activepieces.com/pieces/hacker-news.png',
  auth: PieceAuth.None(),
  authors: [],
  actions: [],
  triggers: [],
});
```

## Action Definition

Now let's create first action which fetch top stories from hackernews, The first step to do that is to create folder for the actions inside the hackernews folder (`packages/pieces/hacker-news/src/lib/`).

```bash
cd packages/pieces/hacker-news/src/lib/ && mkdir actions && cd actions
```

Next, Let's create the action file:

```bash
touch fetch-top-stories.ts
```

Inside this file, paste the following code:

<Tip>
  You can ask ChatGPT3 to write the function to get top stories from hackernews.
</Tip>

```typescript
import {
  createAction,
  Property,
  PieceAuth,
} from '@activepieces/pieces-framework';
import { httpClient, HttpMethod } from '@activepieces/pieces-common';

export const fetchTopStories = createAction({
  name: 'fetch_top_stories', // Must be a unique across the piece, this shouldn't be changed.
  auth: PieceAuth.None(),
  displayName: 'Fetch Top Stories',
  description: 'Fetch top stories from hackernews',
  props: {
    // Properties to ask from the user, in this ask we will take number of
    number_of_stories: Property.Number({
      displayName: 'Number of Stories',
      description: undefined,
      required: true,
    }),
  },
  async run(context) {
    const HACKER_NEWS_API_URL = 'https://hacker-news.firebaseio.com/v0/';
    const topStoryIdsResponse = await httpClient.sendRequest<string[]>({
      method: HttpMethod.GET,
      url: `${HACKER_NEWS_API_URL}topstories.json`,
    });
    const topStoryIds: string[] = topStoryIdsResponse.body;
    const topStories = [];
    for (
      let i = 0;
      i < Math.min(context.propsValue['number_of_stories'], topStoryIds.length);
      i++
    ) {
      const storyId = topStoryIds[i];
      const storyResponse = await httpClient.sendRequest({
        method: HttpMethod.GET,
        url: `${HACKER_NEWS_API_URL}item/${storyId}.json`,
      });
      topStories.push(storyResponse.body);
    }
    return topStories;
  },
});
```

<Tip>
  Friendly Tip: You can use `context.auth` If your piece contains authentication
  for this example, It doesn't have.
</Tip>
This code defines an `action` that fetches the top stories from Hacker News using
API.

The createAction function takes an object with several properties, including the `name`, `displayName`, `description`, `props`, and `run` function of the action.

The `name` property is a unique identifier for the action. The `displayName` and `description` properties are used to provide a human-readable name and description for the action.

The `props` property is an object that defines the properties that the action requires from the user. In this case, the action requires a single property called `number_of_stories`, which is a number representing the number of stories to fetch.

The `run` function is the function that is called when the action is executed. It takes a single argument, context, which contains the values of the action's properties.

The `run` function first defines the URL of the Hacker News API, and then makes a GET request to the topstories.json endpoint using the httpClient.sendRequest function to fetch the top story IDs. It then iterates over the top story IDs and makes a GET request to the `item/{id}.json` endpoint for each story ID to fetch the details of each story. Finally, it returns the top stories as an array.

## Expose The Definition

To make the action readable by Activepieces, add it to the array of actions in the piece definition.

```typescript
import { createPiece } from '@activepieces/pieces-framework';
// Don't forget to add the following import.
import { fetchTopStories } from './lib/actions/fetch-top-stories';

export const hackerNews = createPiece({
  displayName: 'Hackernews Tutorial',
  logoUrl: 'https://cdn.activepieces.com/pieces/hackernews.png',
  authors: [],
  auth: PieceAuth.None(),
  // Add the action here.
  actions: [fetchTopStories], // <--------
  triggers: [],
});
```

# Testing

<Tip>
  By default dvelopment setup only builds modified pieces. If you want a new
  piece to be built automatically upon `npm start`, make sure you read about
  [Piece Development](../development-setup/getting-started) section.
</Tip>

Once you make an edit, the piece will be rebuilt. After this is finished, you'll need to **refresh** the frontend to see the changes.

To test the action, you can use the Flow Builder in Activepieces. It should work just like the screenshot demonstrates.
