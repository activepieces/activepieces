## Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial where we will walk through the process of creating a ClickUp piece in Activepiece. By following this guide, you'll learn the fundamental steps to build a seamless integration with ClickUp using the Activepiece framework.

Follow along as we guide you through each step, providing insights into creating a robust ClickUp piece. By the end, you'll not only have a functional integration but also a foundational understanding of Activepiece development. Let's dive in and empower your applications with ClickUp integration!

Let's Get Started!!

<Tip>
  **Friendly Tip #1:** For experimentation, fork or clone the public repository.
</Tip>

## Create a Public Fork (Public Pieces)

Click the `Fork` button in the top right corner of the repository page (https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces)

## Create a Private Fork (Private Pieces)

<Tip>
  Private piece installation is available under the paid edition. You can still
  develop pieces, contribute them back, **OR** publish them to the public npm
  registry and use it in your own instance / project.
</Tip>

By following these steps, you can create a private fork on GitHub, GitLab or another platform and configure the "activepieces" repository as the upstream source, allowing you to incorporate changes from the "activepieces" repository.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

Begin by creating a bare clone of the repository. Remember that this is a temporary step and will be deleted later.

```bash
git clone --bare git@github.com:activepieces/activepieces.git
```

2. **Create a Private Git Repository**

Generate a new private repository on GitHub or your chosen platform. When initializing the new repository, do not include a README, license, or gitignore files. This precaution is essential to avoid merge conflicts when synchronizing your fork with the original repository.

3. **Mirror-Push to the Private Repository:**

Mirror-push the bare clone you created earlier to your newly created "activepieces" repository. Make sure to replace `<your_username>` in the URL below with your actual GitHub username.

```bash
cd activepieces.git
git push --mirror git@github.com:<your_username>/activepieces.git
```

4. **Remove the Temporary Local Repository:**

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf activepieces.git
```

5. **Clone Your Private Repository:**

Now, you can clone your "activepieces" repository onto your local machine into your desired directory.

```bash
cd ~/path/to/directory
git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/activepieces.git
```

6. **Add the Original Repository as a Remote:**

If desired, you can add the original repository as a remote to fetch potential future changes. However, remember to disable push operations for this remote, as you are not permitted to push changes to it.

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:activepieces/activepieces.git
git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLE
```

You can view a list of all your remotes using `git remote -v`. It should resemble the following:

```
origin	git@github.com:<your_username>/activepieces.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:<your_username>/activepieces.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:activepieces/activepieces.git (fetch)
upstream	DISABLE (push)
```

> When pushing changes, always use `git push origin`.

### Sync Your Fork

To retrieve changes from the "upstream" repository, fetch the remote and rebase your work on top of it.

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Conflict resolution should not be necessary since you've only added pieces to your repository.
