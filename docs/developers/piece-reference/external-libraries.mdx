The Ensemble repository is structured as a monorepo, employing Nx as its build tool.

To use an external library in your project, you can simply add it to the main `package.json` file and then use it in any part of your project.

Nx will automatically detect where you're using the library and include it in the build.

Here's how to install and use an external library:

- Install the library using:

```bash
npm install --save <library-name>
```

- Import the library into your piece.

Guidelines:
- Make sure you are using well-maintained libraries.
- Ensure that the library size is not too large to avoid bloating the bundle size; this will make the piece load faster in the sandbox.
