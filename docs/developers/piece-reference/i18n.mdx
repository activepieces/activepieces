<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate">
     Translation files are created automatically while you develop your piece.

     Add your piece to [AP_DEV_PIECES](/developers/development-setup/local) and run: 
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

     Each time you make changes to your piece, a translation file will be generated.
     Look for this message in your terminal: `Translation file for piece created in <piece_folder>/src/i18n/translation.json`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Translate">
     Create a file named `<piece_folder>/src/i18n/<locale>.json` and translate the values from the translation file.
    <Tip>
      For open source pieces, you can use the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/activepieces) to translate to different languages. These translations will automatically sync back to your code.

   <Step title="Test Locally">
    Go to your dashboard: Project Settings -> Appearance -> Languages
    ![Languages](/resources/i18n-pieces.png)
   
    Create or edit the locale file (like fr.json) in your piece directory. Refresh the UI to see your changes.
  
    Your piece will now appear in the translated language:
