We understand that pieces are a crucial part of using Activepieces to automate your work. If you are looking for a specific piece and can't find it in the docs or in the repo, you can take one of the following actions:

**1. Use helper pieces**

In many cases, helper pieces can get you the outcome you desire. Here are some examples:

- If you'd like to communicate with a service that has APIs, you can use the generic [HTTP Request piece](./helpers/http-request) to send the request to that service.

- If you'd like to parse a CSV file as an array, you can use the [Code piece](./helpers/code) with a relevant npm package to achieve your goal.

**2. Request the piece**

The community is working actively on adding more pieces to the official GitHub repository, building priorities become clearer with guidance from users like you.

You can request a new piece by:
- Posting the requesting, or upvoting an existing request on the [Piece Requests](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/discussions/categories/piece-requests) board.
- Joining our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2jUXBKDdP8) and suggesting the piece directly to the team.

**3. Make the piece**

If you are a developer and don't wish to wait until the piece is built by the community, we've put up a [guide to building a new piece](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/contributing/getting-started).

You can follow the structure and steps in the guide to build your piece for your own use or to contribute with it to Activepieces.
