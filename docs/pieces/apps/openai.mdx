## Actions


      <Card title="Ask ChatGPT " >
        Ask ChatGPT anything you want!

        <Expandable title="Properties">
          
<ResponseField name="Model" required type="Dropdown">
The model which will generate the completion. Some models are suitable for natural language tasks, others specialize in code.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Question" required type="Long_text">
The question to ask OpenAI.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Temperature"  type="Number">
Controls randomness: Lowering results in less random completions. As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic and repetitive.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Maximum Tokens"  type="Number">
The maximum number of tokens to generate. Requests can use up to 2,048 or 4,096 tokens shared between prompt and completion, don't set the value to maximum and leave some tokens for the input. The exact limit varies by model. (One token is roughly 4 characters for normal English text)
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Top P"  type="Number">
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Frequency penalty"  type="Number">
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Presence penalty"  type="Number">
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the mode's likelihood to talk about new topics.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Roles"  type="Json">
Array of roles to specify more accurate response
</ResponseField>

      </Card>

  <Card title="Generate embeddings">
    Chuck a text and generate embeddings for it
    <Expandable title="Properties">
      <ResponseField name="Text Input" required type="Long_text">
        Enter the text input you want to tarsform to embeddings
      </ResponseField>
      <ResponseField name="Document Title or Md5 ID" required type="Short_text">
        What is the title or the Md5 ID of the text or document you\'ve inputted
      </ResponseField>
      <ResponseField name="Split by" type="Dropdown" required>
        Define where the text will be split
      </ResponseField>
      <ResponseField name="Min number of token by embedding" type="Number">
        After which number of tokens the text will be split
      </ResponseField>
      <ResponseField name="Max number of token by embedding" type="Number">
        After the text was split, if this value is inferior to the number of tokens, the text will be split again
      </ResponseField>
