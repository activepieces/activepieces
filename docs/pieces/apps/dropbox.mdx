      <Card title="Create New Text File " >
        Create a new text file in your Dropbox from text input

        <Expandable title="Properties">
          
<ResponseField name="Path" required type="Short_text">

</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Mute"  type="Checkbox">
Normally, users are made aware of any file modifications in their Dropbox account via notifications in the client software. If true, this tells the clients that this modification shouldn't result in a user notification.
</ResponseField>
            
<ResponseField name="Strict conflict"  type="Checkbox">
Be more strict about how each WriteMode detects conflict. For example, always return a conflict error when mode = WriteMode.update and the given "rev" doesn't match the existing file's "rev", even if the existing file has been deleted.
</ResponseField>
              
        </Expandable>
      </Card>
