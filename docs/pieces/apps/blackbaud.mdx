## Authentication

To obtain the subscription key, client ID, and client secret for Blackbaud, you will need to follow these steps:

1- Go to the Blackbaud Developer Portal (https://developer.blackbaud.com/) and sign in with your Blackbaud account.
2- Navigate to the "My Apps" section and click on the "Create New App" button.
3- Fill in the required information for the new application, including the name, description, and redirect URI.
4- Choose the API scopes that the application needs access to.
5- Click on the "Create" button to create the new application.
6- Once the application is created, you will be taken to the application's details page. On this page, you will find the client ID, and client secret for the application.
7- Go to the "My Subscription" page, and copy the subscription key.

<Tip>
Please note that this is a general guidance and you should check Blackbaud's API documentation for any specific information or requirement on the process of obtaining the subscription key, client ID and client secret.

## Insert Batch Contacts Sample Input

This connector will enable you to insert multiple contacts into Blackbaud by inputting a variable or a raw JSON text. It will parse the input and insert each contact individually, as there is no batch endpoint available.
