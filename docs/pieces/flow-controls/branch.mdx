## Overview

The branch piece helps you split your flow into two paths depending on a condition.

This piece currently supports two types of conditions.

Unary conditions: Takes one value and checks if the condition applies to it.

- (Boolean) is true
- (Boolean) is false
- Doesn't Exist: checks if the value is an empty value (null/undefined/empty string)
- Exists: checks if the value is a non empty value.

Binary conditions: Takes two values and checks if the condition applies to them.

- (Text) contains: checks if the first value (string) contains the second value (substring).
- (Text) doesn't contain: checks if the first value (string) doesn't contain the second value (substring).
- (Text) exactly matches: checks if the two values (strings) are equal.
- (Text) starts with: checks if the first value (string) starts with the second value (substring).
- (Text) doesn't not start with: checks if the first value (string) doesn't start with the second value (substring).
- (Text) ends with: checks if the first value (string) ends with the second value (substring).
- (Text) doesn't not end with: checks if the first value (string) doesn't end with the second value (substring).
- (Number) is greater than.
- (Number) is less than.

<Note> Conditions can get grouped by (Or/And) operators. </Note>
