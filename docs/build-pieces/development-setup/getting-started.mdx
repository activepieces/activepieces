## Development Setup 

To set up the development environment, you can choose one of the following methods:

- **Codespaces**: This is the quickest way to set up the development environment. Follow the [Codespaces](./codespaces) guide.
- **Local Environment**: It is recommended for local development. Follow the [Local Environment](./local) guide.


## Pieces Development

When [`AP_SYNC_MODE`](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/packages/server/api/.env#L17) is set to `OFFICIAL_AUTO`, all pieces are automatically loaded from the cloud API and synced to the database on first launch. This process may take a few seconds to several minutes depending on your internet connection.

For local development, pieces are loaded from your local `dist` folder instead of the database. To enable this, set the [`AP_DEV_PIECES`](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/packages/server/api/.env#L4) environment variable with a comma-separated list of pieces. For example, to develop with `google-sheets` and `cal-com`:

```sh
AP_DEV_PIECES=google-sheets,cal-com npm start
```
