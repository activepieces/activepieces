The Activepieces repository is structured as a monorepo, employing Nx as its build tool.

To keep our main `package.json` as light as possible, we keep libraries that are only used for a piece in the piece `package.json` . This means when adding a new library you should navigate to the piece folder and install the library with our package manager `bun`

```bash
cd packages/pieces/<piece-path> 
bun install --save <library-name>
```

- Import the library into your piece.

Guidelines:
- Make sure you are using well-maintained libraries.
- Ensure that the library size is not too large to avoid bloating the bundle size; this will make the piece load faster in the sandbox.
