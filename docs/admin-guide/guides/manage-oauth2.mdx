## Default Behavior

When users connect to services like Google Sheets or Slack, they see "Activepieces" as the app requesting access. This works out of the box with no setup required.

## Why Replace OAuth2 Apps?

- **Branding**: Show your company name instead of "Activepieces" in authorization screens
- **Higher Limits**: Some services have stricter rate limits for shared OAuth apps
- **Compliance**: Your organization may require using company-owned credentials

## How to Configure

1. Go to **Platform Admin → Setup → Pieces**
2. Find the piece you want to configure (e.g., Google Sheets)
3. Click the lock icon to open the OAuth2 settings
4. Enter your own Client ID and Client Secret
