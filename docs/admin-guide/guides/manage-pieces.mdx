## Overview

**Pieces** are the building blocks of Activepieces — they are integrations and connectors (like Google Sheets, Slack, OpenAI, etc.) that users can use in their automation flows.

As a platform administrator, you have full control over which pieces are available to your users. This allows you to:

- **Enforce security policies** by restricting access to certain integrations
- **Simplify the user experience** by showing only relevant pieces for your use case
- **Deploy custom/private pieces** that are specific to your organization

There are **two levels** of piece management:

| Level | Who Can Manage | Scope |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| **Platform Level** | Platform Admin | Install and remove across the entire platform |
| **Project Level** | Project Admin | Show/hide specific pieces for specfic project |

---

## Platform-Level Management

Platform administrators can manage pieces for the entire Activepieces instance from **Platform Admin → Setup → Pieces**.

## Project-Level Management

Project administrators can further restrict which pieces are available within their specific project. This is useful when different teams or projects need access to different integrations.

### Show/Hide Pieces in a Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    Navigate to your project and go to **Settings → Pieces**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Visibility">
    You'll see a list of all pieces installed on the platform. Toggle the visibility for each piece:
    - **Enabled**: Users in this project can use the piece
    - **Disabled**: The piece is hidden from users in this project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Changes take effect immediately — users will only see the enabled pieces when building their flows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Project-level settings can only **hide** pieces that are installed at the platform level. You cannot add pieces at the project level that aren't already installed on the platform.
</Note>


### Install Private Pieces

<Tip>
For detailed instructions on building custom pieces, check the [Building Pieces](/build-pieces/building-pieces/overview) documentation.
</Tip>


If you've built a custom piece for your organization, you can upload it directly as a tarball (`.tgz`) file.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build Your Piece">
    Build your piece using the Activepieces CLI:
    ```bash
    npm run pieces -- build --name=your-piece-name
    ```
    This generates a tarball in `dist/packages/pieces/your-piece-name`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Pieces Settings">
    Go to **Platform Admin → Setup → Pieces** and click **Install Piece**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select File Upload">
    Choose **Upload File** as the installation source.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the Tarball">
    Select the `.tgz` file from your build output and upload it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
