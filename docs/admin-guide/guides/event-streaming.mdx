## Overview

Event Streaming allows you to configure webhook destinations that receive real-time notifications when specific events occur in your Activepieces platform. This enables you to integrate Activepieces with external systems, monitoring tools, analytics platforms, or custom applications.

## Use Cases

- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Track flow executions, user activity, and system changes in real-time
- **Integration**: Sync events with external systems like SIEM tools, data warehouses, or custom dashboards
- **Compliance**: Maintain audit trails in external systems for compliance requirements
- **Automation**: Trigger downstream processes based on platform events

## Available Events

You can configure destinations to receive the following event types:

### Flow Events
- **Flow Created**: When a new flow is created
- **Flow Updated**: When a flow is modified
- **Flow Deleted**: When a flow is removed
- **Flow Run Started**: When a flow execution begins
- **Flow Run Finished**: When a flow execution completes
- **Flow Run Resumed**: When a paused flow execution resumes

### Folder Events
- **Folder Created**: When a new folder is created
- **Folder Updated**: When a folder is modified
- **Folder Deleted**: When a folder is removed

### Connection Events
- **Connection Upserted**: When a connection is created or updated
- **Connection Deleted**: When a connection is removed

### User Events
- **User Signed Up**: When a new user registers
- **User Signed In**: When a user logs in
- **User Password Reset**: When a password reset is requested
- **User Email Verified**: When a user verifies their email

### Security Events
- **Signing Key Created**: When a new signing key is generated
- **Project Role Created**: When a project role is created
- **Project Role Updated**: When a project role is modified
- **Project Role Deleted**: When a project role is removed
- **Project Release Created**: When a project release is created

## How to Configure

1. Go to **Platform Admin → Infrastructure → Event Destinations**
2. Click **Create Destination**
3. Enter your **Webhook URL** (must be a valid HTTPS endpoint)
4. Select the **Events** you want to receive
5. Click **Test Destination** to verify the connection (optional)
6. Click **Create Destination** to save

## Requirements

- **Enterprise Edition**: Event Streaming requires an enterprise plan with Audit Logs enabled
- **HTTPS Endpoint**: Webhook URLs must use HTTPS
- **Publicly Accessible**: Your endpoint must be accessible from the internet

## Troubleshooting

- **Events Not Received**: Verify your endpoint is publicly accessible and returns 2xx status codes
- **Test Fails**: Check that your URL is valid and uses HTTPS
- **Missing Events**: Ensure the event type is selected in your destination configuration
