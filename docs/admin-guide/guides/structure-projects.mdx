Projects in Activepieces are the main units for organizing your automations and resources within your organization. Every project contains its own flows, connections, and tables. Access to these resources is shared among everyone who has access to that project.

There are two types of projects:
- **Personal Projects**: Each user invited to your organization automatically receives a personal project. This is a private space where only that user can create and manage flows, connections, and tables.
- **Team Projects**: Team projects are shared spaces that can be created and managed from this page. Multiple users can be invited to a team project, allowing them to collaborate, share access to flows, connections, and tables, and work together.

When organizing your work, create team projects for group collaboration and utilize personal projects for individual or private tasks.
