AI providers are configured by the platform admin to centrally manage credentials and access, making [AI pieces](https://www.activepieces.com/pieces/ai) and their features available to everyone in all projects.

## Supported Providers

- **OpenAI**
- **Anthropic**
- **Gemini**
- **Vercel AI Gateway**

## Cost Control & Logging

Use an AI gateway like **Vercel AI Gateway** or **Cloudflare AI Gateway** to:

- Set rate limits and budgets
- Log and monitor all AI requests
- Track usage across projects

Just set the gateway URL as your provider's base URL in the Admin Console.
