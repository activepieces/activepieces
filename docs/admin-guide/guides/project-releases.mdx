Project Releases allow you to sync flows, connections, and tables between different environments. This is essential for teams that want to develop in one project and deploy to another, or maintain version control through Git integration.

## Overview

There are three ways to create a release:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Git** | Pull changes from a connected Git repository |
| **Project** | Copy flows from another project in your platform |
| **Rollback** | Restore a previous release state |

![Project Releases Overview](/resources/screenshots/project-releases-overview.png)

## Prerequisites

<Note>
  Git integration requires **Environments** to be enabled on your platform plan. If you only need to sync between projects or rollback releases, you can skip this section.
</Note>

### Enabling Environments

To use Git sync with Project Releases, you must first have the Environments feature enabled on your platform. This feature allows you to deploy flows across development, staging, and production environments with version control and team collaboration.

Contact your platform administrator to enable Environments if you see a locked feature screen when accessing the Environment settings.

![Enable Environments](/resources/screenshots/enable-environments.png)

## Getting Started

Navigate to the **Releases** page from your project sidebar to view all releases and create new ones.

![Project Releases Page](/resources/screenshots/project-releases-page.png)

## Connecting Git (Optional)

If you want to use Git as your source of truth, you'll need to connect a Git repository first. This requires the Environments feature to be enabled.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Environment Settings">
    Go to **Project Settings** → **Environment** to access the Git configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Connect Git">
    Click the **Connect Git** button to open the configuration dialog.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Repository Details">
    Fill in the following information:
    - **Remote URL**: Your Git repository SSH URL (e.g., `git@github.com:yourorg/yourrepo.git`)
    - **Branch**: The branch to sync with (e.g., `main`)
    - **Folder**: The folder name where project files will be stored
    - **SSH Private Key**: Your SSH private key for authentication
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect">
    Click **Connect** to establish the connection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

![Connect Git Dialog](/resources/screenshots/connect-git-dialog.png)

<Tip>
  Make sure your SSH key has read/write access to the repository. The key should start with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`.
</Tip>

### Disconnecting Git

If you need to disconnect your Git repository:

1. Go to **Project Settings** → **Environment**
2. Click the **Disconnect** button next to your connected repository
3. Confirm the disconnection

After disconnecting, you can connect a different repository or continue using Project Releases without Git.

## Understanding the Changes Preview

When creating a release, you'll see a preview of all changes:

### Flow Changes

- <span style={{color: 'green'}}>**Green (+ icon)**</span>: New flows that will be created
- <span style={{color: 'blue'}}>**Blue (pencil icon)**</span>: Existing flows that will be updated
- <span style={{color: 'red'}}>**Red (trash icon)**</span>: Flows that will be deleted

### Connection Changes

- New connections are placeholders and must be reconnected after the release
- Renamed connections show both the old and new names

### Table Changes

- New, updated, and deleted tables are shown with their respective indicators

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Give your releases meaningful names like "v1.2.0 - Added email notifications" to easily identify them later.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Before Applying" icon="eye">
    Always review the changes preview carefully before applying a release to avoid unexpected modifications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test in Development" icon="flask">
    If using Git sync, test changes in a development project before deploying to production.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Document Changes" icon="file-lines">
    Use the description field to document what changed and why for future reference.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Permissions

To create and manage releases, you need the **Write Project Release** permission. Contact your platform administrator if you don't have access to the releases feature.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment settings are locked">
    The Environments feature must be enabled on your platform plan to use Git sync. Contact your platform administrator to upgrade your plan or enable this feature.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Git connection fails">
    - Verify your SSH private key is correct and has proper permissions
    - Ensure the remote URL is in SSH format (not HTTPS)
    - Check that the branch exists in the repository
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No changes detected">
    If no changes appear when creating a release, it means your current project is already in sync with the source.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection placeholders">
    After applying a release with new connections, navigate to the Connections page and reconnect them with valid credentials.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push Everything button not visible">
    This button only appears when your project is connected to Git as a development branch. Check your Git configuration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot find Environment settings">
    Navigate to **Project Settings** from the sidebar, then click on **Environment**. If you don't see this option, the Environments feature may not be enabled for your platform.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
