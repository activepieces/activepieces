## What is SCIM?

SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) lets your identity provider automatically create, update, and deactivate users in Activepieces.

## What SCIM Handles

- **Provision users** when they are assigned in your identity provider
- **Sync profile updates** such as name or email changes
- **Deprovision users** when access is removed or accounts are deactivated

## SCIM and SSO

SCIM handles user lifecycle management.  
SSO handles sign-in and authentication.

You can use both together so user access is managed centrally in your identity provider.
