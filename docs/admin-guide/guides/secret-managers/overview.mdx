Secret Managers allow you to integrate external secret management systems with Activepieces, enabling centralized credential management and enhanced security for your global connections.

<Snippet file="enterprise-feature.mdx" />

## Benefits

- **Centralized Management**: Store all credentials in one secure location
- **Enhanced Security**: Credentials are managed by dedicated secret management systems
- **Audit & Compliance**: Track access and changes to secrets
- **Rotation Support**: Easily rotate credentials without updating flows
- **Access Control**: Use your existing secret manager access policies

## Supported Providers

- **[HashiCorp Vault](./hashicorp)** - Enterprise-grade secrets management
- **[CyberArk Conjur](./cyberark-conjur)** - Centralized secrets management with host-based authentication

## How to Connect

1. Go to **Platform Admin → Security → Secret Managers**
2. Select the secret manager provider you want to connect
3. Follow the provider-specific setup instructions in the provider documentation
4. Enter the required connection details
5. Click **Connect** to test and save the connection

The connection will be encrypted and stored securely. You can disconnect at any time by clicking the **Remove** button.

## Using Secret Managers in Global Connections

Once connected, you can use secret managers when creating or editing global connections:

1. When configuring a global connection that requires credentials (like API keys or passwords)
2. Click the **key icon** (🔑) next to the input field
3. Select your secret manager provider from the dropdown
4. Enter the secret path/identifier required by your provider (see provider-specific documentation)
5. The connection will automatically retrieve the secret from your secret manager when needed

## How It Works

When you use a secret manager in a connection:

- The global connection stores a reference to the secret (not the actual credential)
- When the flow runs, Activepieces authenticates with your secret manager and retrieves the secret
- Secrets are fetched on-demand and never stored in Activepieces
- If the secret is updated in your secret manager, flows will use the new value after the cache expires (up to 1 hour), or immediately after clearing the cache

## Caching

Connection checks and retrieved secrets are cached in memory for **1 hour** to reduce latency and provider API load.

To force a refresh (e.g. after rotating credentials or updating secrets), platform admins can clear the cache in the secret managers setup page

![Clear secret manager cache](/resources/screenshots/clear-secret-manager-cache.png)

or by calling the endpoint

```
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://<domain>/api/v1/secret-managers/cache \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

## Security Considerations

- **Encryption**: Secret managers authentication configuration is encrypted
- **Access Control**: Use your secret manager's access policies to control who can access secrets
- **Network Security**: Ensure your secret manager is accessible from your Activepieces instance
- **Credential Management**: Regularly rotate authentication credentials for secret managers

## Troubleshooting

**Connection Failed:**
- Verify the connection details are correct and accessible
- Check that authentication credentials are valid
- Ensure network connectivity between Activepieces and your secret manager
- Review provider-specific troubleshooting guides

**Secret Not Found:**
- Verify the secret path/name is correct
- Check that the secret exists in your secret manager
- Ensure the authentication credentials have permissions to read the secret

**Permission Denied:**
- Verify the authentication credentials have the necessary permissions
- Check your secret manager's access control policies
- Review audit logs in your secret manager for detailed error information
