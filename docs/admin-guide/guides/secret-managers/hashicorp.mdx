HashiCorp Vault is an enterprise-grade secrets management system that provides secure storage and access to secrets, API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting HashiCorp Vault to Activepieces, ensure you have:

- **HashiCorp Vault Key-value (KV) secrets engine** version 2
- **AppRole auth method** [enabled](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/approle)
- **One or more AppRoles** [configured](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/approle) with appropriate policies

## Policies

Enable The created AppRole to access your secrets engine(s) by adding the following to your policy

```
path "<secret_engine_name>/data/<secret_name>" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
```
or 
```
path "<secret_engine_name>/data/*" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}
```

## Connecting to Activepieces

1. Go to **Platform Admin → Security → Secret Managers**
2. Select **HashiCorp Vault** from the provider list
3. Enter the required connection details:
   - **URL**: Your Vault server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8200`)
   - **Role ID**: The Role ID from your AppRole configuration
   - **Secret ID**: The Secret ID from your AppRole configuration
   - **Namespace** (optional): Vault namespace if using Vault Enterprise namespaces
4. Click **Connect** to test and save the connection

## Using HashiCorp Vault Secrets

When configuring a connection that requires credentials:

1. Click the **key icon** (🔑) next to the input field
2. Select **HashiCorp Vault** from the dropdown
3. Enter the secret path in the format: `mount/data/path/key`
   - if key is added via cli command `vault kv put -mount=secret app api_key='abc'`
   - the input value should be secret/data/app/api_key

The connection will automatically retrieve the secret from Vault when the flow runs.
