1Password Secrets Automation lets you securely store and retrieve credentials from 1Password vaults. This integration uses a **service account token** to authenticate with the 1Password SDK.

## Prerequisites

- A 1Password account with the **Teams** or **Business** plan (service accounts require a paid plan)
- Permission to create service accounts in your 1Password account

## Step 1 — Create a service account

1. Sign in to [1password.com](https://1password.com) and go to **Developer Tools → Service Accounts**.
2. Click **Create a service account**.
3. Give it a name (e.g. `Activepieces`).
4. Grant it **Read Items** access on the vaults Activepieces needs to access.
5. Click **Create service account** and copy the token — it starts with `ops_` and is shown only once.

<Warning>
  Store the token securely. Once you leave the page, 1Password will not show it again.
</Warning>

## Step 2 — Connect in Activepieces

1. Go to **Platform Admin → Security → Secret Managers**.
2. Select **1Password** from the provider list.
3. Paste the **Service Account Token** from Step 1.
4. Click **Connect** to test and save the connection.

## Using 1Password in connections

When configuring a global connection that requires credentials:

1. Click the **key icon** (🔑) next to the credential field.
2. Select **1Password** as the secret manager.
3. Enter the **Secret Reference** in the format:
   ```
   op://vault/item/field
   ```
   - **vault** — the vault name or ID (e.g. `Production`)
   - **item** — the item title or ID (e.g. `Stripe`)
   - **field** — the field label within the item (e.g. `password`, `api key`)

Activepieces will retrieve the secret value from 1Password and inject it into the connection at runtime.

<Tip>
  The easiest way to get the exact reference is to open the 1Password desktop app, right-click any field, and select **Copy Secret Reference**. This copies the `op://...` string ready to paste.
</Tip>

## Example secret references

| 1Password location | Reference |
|---|---|
| Vault `Production` → Item `Stripe` → Field `Secret Key` | `op://Production/Stripe/Secret Key` |
| Vault `Shared` → Item `Database` → Field `password` | `op://Shared/Database/password` |

<Warning>
  If you update existing secrets and you can't see the update reflected, refer to [caching](/admin-guide/guides/secret-managers/overview#caching).
