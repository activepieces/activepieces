AWS Secrets Manager helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources. This integration uses **IAM user credentials** (Access Key + Secret Key) to authenticate directly with AWS Secrets Manager.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with permissions to create IAM users and policies
- Permissions to create and manage secrets in AWS Secrets Manager

## Step 1 — Create an IAM policy for Secrets Manager access

Create an IAM policy that grants read access to the secrets Activepieces will retrieve.

1. Open the [IAM console → Policies → Create policy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies$new?step=edit).
2. Switch to the **JSON** tab and paste:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
        "secretsmanager:ListSecrets",
        "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Tip>
For production, scope `Resource` to the specific secret ARNs Activepieces needs instead of using `"*"`.
</Tip>

3. Click **Next**, name the policy (e.g. `ActivepiecesSecretsReadOnly`), and create it.

## Step 2 — Create an IAM user and attach the policy

1. Open the [IAM console → Users → Create user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users$new).
2. Enter a username (e.g. `activepieces-secrets-user`) and click **Next**.
3. Select **Attach policies directly**, find and attach the policy created in Step 1, then click **Next** and **Create user**.
4. Open the newly created user, go to the **Security credentials** tab, and click **Create access key**.
5. Select **Application running outside AWS**, click **Next**, then **Create access key**.
6. Copy the **Access Key** and **Secret Key** — you will need both in the next step.

## Step 3 — Connect in Activepieces

1. Go to **Platform Admin → Security → Secret Managers**.
2. Select **AWS Secrets Manager** from the provider list.
3. Enter the connection details:
   - **Access Key** — the Access Key ID from Step 2 (e.g. `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`).
   - **Secret Key** — the Secret Access Key from Step 2.
   - **Region** — the AWS region where your secrets are stored (e.g. `us-east-1`).
4. Click **Connect** to test and save the connection.

## Using AWS Secrets Manager in connections

When configuring a global connection that requires credentials:

1. Click the **key icon** (🔑) next to the credential field.
2. Select **AWS Secrets Manager** as the secret manager.
3. Fill in:
   - **Secret Name** — the friendly name of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager.
   - **Secret Json key** — Key of row for the stored secret.

Activepieces will use the configured credentials to retrieve the secret value and inject it into the connection at runtime.

  If you update existing secrets and you can't see the update reflected . refer to [caching](/admin-guide/guides/secret-managers/overview#caching)
