Activepieces utilizes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for managing permissions within projects. Each project consists of multiple flows and users, with each user assigned specific roles that define their actions within the project.

## Default Roles

Activepieces comes with four standard roles out of the box. The table below shows the permissions for each role:

| Permission | Admin | Editor | Operator | Viewer |
|------------|:-----:|:------:|:--------:|:------:|
| **Flows** |||||
| View Flows | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Edit Flows | ✓ | ✓ | | |
| Publish / Toggle Flows | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| **Runs** |||||
| View Runs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Retry Runs | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| **Connections** |||||
| View Connections | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Edit Connections | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | |
| **Team** |||||
| View Project Members | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Add/Remove Project Members | ✓ | | | |
| **Git Sync**    |      |        |      |      |
| Configure Git Repo      | ✓    |        |      |      |
| Pull Flows from Git     | ✓    |        |      |      |
| Push Flows to Git       | ✓    |        |      |      |

## Custom Roles

If the default roles don't fit your needs, you can create custom roles with specific permissions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Project Roles">
    Go to **Platform Admin** → **Security** → **Project Roles**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a New Role">
    Click **Create Role** and give it a name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    Select the specific permissions you want to grant to this role
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Custom roles are useful when you need fine-grained control, such as allowing users to view and retry runs without being able to edit flows.
