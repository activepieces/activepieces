Activepieces keeps track of all published flows and their versions. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. You can edit a flow as many times as you want in **draft** mode.
2. Once you're done with your changes, you can publish it.
3. The published flow will be **immutable** and cannot be edited.
4. If you try to edit a published flow, Activepieces will create a new **draft** if there is none and copy the **published** version to the new version.

This means you can always go back to a previous version and edit the flow in draft mode without affecting the published version.

As you can see in the following screenshot, the yellow dot refers to DRAFT and the green dot refers to PUBLISHED.
