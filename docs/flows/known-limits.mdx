### Execution Limits

- **Flow Execution Time**  
  Maximum: **600 seconds (10 minutes)**  
  Flows exceeding this limit will be marked as timed out.

- **Memory Usage**  
  Maximum: **1 GB RAM**  
  (Self hosted can be configured via `AP_SANDBOX_MEMORY_LIMIT`)

<Note>
The memory usage is measured for the entire Node.js process running the flow. There is approximately 300 MB of overhead for a warm process with pieces already loaded.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Note 1:** Flows paused by steps like **Wait for Approval** or **Delay** do **not** count toward the 600-second limit.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Note 2:** To handle longer processes, split them into multiple flows.  
For example:  
- Have one flow call another via **webhook**.  
- Process smaller **batches of items** in separate flows.
</Tip>

### File Storage Limits

<Info>
Files from actions or triggers are stored in the database/S3 to support retries for certain steps.
</Info>

- **Maximum File Size**: **10 MB**  
  (Configurable via `AP_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`, default: **4 MB**)

### Key / Value Storage Limits

Some pieces use the built-in Activepieces key store (e.g., **Store Piece**, **Queue Piece**).

- **Maximum Key Length**: **128 characters**  
- **Maximum Value Size**: **512 KB**
