The Git Sync feature allows for the creation of an **external backup**, **environments**, and maintaining a **version history**.


### How It Works:

This example explains a simple setup for creating development and production environments. The setup can be extended to include multiple environments and multiple Git branches.

**Requirements:**
- Empty Git Repository
- Two Projects in Activepieces: one for Development and one for Production.

#### 1. Push Flow to the repository

After making changes in the flow, You click on arrow near the flow name and select "Push to Git", Add commit and puysh.

### 2. Pull from the Repository

<Note>
Please note that the credentials will not be synced automatically. You should manually create identical credentials with the same names in both environments.
</Note>

You can trigger a pull from the Git Repository button in Activepieces. This action will replace all flows in the project with those from the git repository.

- All flows that are enabled in production will be updated and republished, If a flow fails to republish, a new version will be created as a draft.
- All flows that are **not** in the git repository will be deleted.
- New flows created in production will be disabled by default.

#### Approval Workflow (Optional)

To manage your approval workflow, you can use Git by creating two branches: development and production. Then, you can use standard pull requests as the approval step.

#### Github action
This GitHub action can be used to automatically pull changes upon merging.

<Tip>
Don't forget to replace `INSTANCE_URL` and `PROJECT_ID`, and add `ACTIVEPIECES_API_KEY` to the secrets.
