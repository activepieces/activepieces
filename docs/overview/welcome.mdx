# 🔥 Why Activepieces is Different:

- **💖 Loved by Everyone**: Intuitive interface and great experience for both technical and non-technical users with a quick learning curve.

- **🌐 Open Ecosystem:** All pieces are open source and available on npmjs.com, **60% of the pieces are contributed by the community**.

- **🛠️  Pieces are written in Typescript**: Pieces are npm packages in TypeScript, offering full customization with the best developer experience, including **hot reloading** for **local** piece development on your machine. 😎

- **🤖 AI-Ready**: Native AI pieces and agents are built into Activepieces. Integrating AI into your flows is seamless and simple—experiment with popular providers, or quickly create custom agents using our easy-to-use AI SDK.

- **🏢 Enterprise-Ready**: Developers set up the tools, and anyone in the organization can use the no-code builder. Full customization from branding to control.

- **🔒 Secure by Design**: Self-hosted and network-gapped for maximum security and control over your data.

- **🧠 Human in Loop**: Delay execution for a period of time or require approval. These are just pieces built on top of the piece framework, and you can build many pieces like that. 🎨
