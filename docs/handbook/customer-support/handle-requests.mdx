### Ticket fields

When handling support tickets, ensure you set the appropriate status and priority to help with ticket management and response time:

### Requests

### Type 1: Quick Fixes & Urgent Issues

* Understand the issue and how urgent it is.
* Open a ticket for on linear with "require attention" label and assign someone.

### Type 2: Complex Technical Issues

* Assess the issue and determine its urgency.
* Always create a Linear issue for the feature request, and send it to the customer.
* Leave a comment on the Linear issue with an estimated completion time.

### Type 3: Feature Enhancement Requests

* Always create a Linear issue for the feature request and send it to the customer.
* Evaluate the request and dig deeper into what the customer is trying to solve, then either evaluate and open a new ticket or append to an existing ticket in the backlog.
* Add it to our roadmap and discuss it with the team.

### Type 4: Business Case
* These cases involve purchasing new features, billing, or discussing agreements.
* Change the Team to "Success" on Pylon.
* Tag someone from the Success Team to handle it.

<Tip>
New features will always have the status "Backlog". Please make sure to communicate that we will discuss and address it in future production cycles so the customer doesn't expect immediate action.
