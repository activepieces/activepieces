At Activepieces, we take a unique approach to customer support. Instead of having dedicated support staff, our full-time engineers handle support requests on rotation. This ensures you get expert technical help from the people who build the product.

### Support Schedule

Our on-call engineer handles customer support as part of their rotation. For more details about how this works, check out our on-call documentation.


### Support Channels
