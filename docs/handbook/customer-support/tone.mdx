Our customers are fellow engineers and great people to work with. This guide will help you understand the tone and communication style that reflects Activepieces' culture in customer support.

#### Casual

Chat with them like you're talking to a friend. There's no need to sound like a robot. For example:
* ✅ "Hey there! How can I help you today?"
* ❌ "Greetings. How may I assist you with your inquiry?"
* ✅ "No worries, we'll get this sorted out together!"
* ❌ "Please hold while I process your request."

#### Fast
Reply quickly! People love fast responses. Even if you don't know the answer right away, let them know you'll get back to them with the information. This is the fastest way to make customers happy; everyone likes to be heard.

#### Honest

Explain the issue clearly, don't be defensive, and be honest. We're all about open source and transparency here – it's part of our culture. For example:
* ✅ "I'm sorry, I forgot to follow up on this. Let's get it sorted out now."
* ❌ "I apologize for the delay; there were unforeseen circumstances."

### Always Communicate the Next Step  

Always clarify the next step, such as whether the ticket will receive an immediate response or be added to the backlog for team discussion.

#### Use "we," not "I"
* ✅ "We made a mistake here. We'll fix that for you."
* ❌ "I'll look into this for you."
* You're speaking on behalf of the company in every email you send.
* Use "we" to show customers they have the whole team's support.

<Tip>
Customers are real people who want to talk to real people. Be yourself, be helpful, and focus on solving their problems!
