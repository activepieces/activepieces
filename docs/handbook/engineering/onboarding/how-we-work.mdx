Activepieces work is based on one-week sprints, as priorities change fast, the sprint has to be short to adapt. 

## Sprints

Sprints are shared publicly on our GitHub account. This would give everyone visibility into what we are working on.

* There should be a GitHub issue for the sprint set up in advance that outlines the changes.
* Each _individual_ should come prepared with specific suggestions for what they will work on over the next sprint. **if you're in an engineering role, no one will dictate to you what to build – it is up to you to drive this.**
* Teams generally meet once a week to pick the **priorities** together.
* Everyone in the team should attend the sprint planning.
* Anyone can comment on the sprint issue before or after the sprint.

## Pull Requests

When it comes to code review, we have a few guidelines to ensure efficiency:

- Create a pull request in draft state as soon as possible.
- Be proactive and review other people’s pull requests. Don’t wait for someone to ask for your review; it’s your responsibility.
- Assign only one reviewer to your pull request.
- **It is the responsibility of the PR owner to draft the test scenarios within the PR description. Upon review, the reviewer may assume that these scenarios have been tested and provide additional suggestions for scenarios.**
- **Large, incomplete features should be broken down into smaller tasks and continuously merged into the main branch.**

## Planning is everyone's job.

Every engineer is responsible for discovering bugs/opportunities and bringing them up in the sprint to convert them into actionable tasks.
