When we develop new features, our marketing team handles the public announcements. As engineers, we need to clearly communicate:

1. The problem the feature solves
2. The benefit to our users
3. How it integrates with our product

### Handoff to Marketing Team

After releasing a feature, create a ticket for the marketing team in Linear: https://linear.app/activepieces/team/MAR/active.

<Tip>
  Please include a video showing the marketing team  on how to use this feature so they can create a demo video and market it correctly.
