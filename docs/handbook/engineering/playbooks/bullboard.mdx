The Bull Board is a tool that allows you to check issues with scheduling and internal flow runs issues.

## Queue Overview

We have one main queue called `workerJobs` that handles all job types. Each job has a `jobType` field that tells us what it does:

### Low Priority Jobs

#### RENEW_WEBHOOK
Renews webhooks for pieces that need to stay connected to external services like Google Sheets.

#### EXECUTE_POLLING
Checks external services for new data at regular intervals.

### Medium Priority Jobs

#### EXECUTE_FLOW
Runs flows when they're triggered, they can also be delayed by rater limiter or paused flows.

#### EXECUTE_WEBHOOK
Processes incoming webhook requests that start flow runs.

#### EXECUTE_AGENT
Runs AI agent tasks within flows.

### High Priority Jobs

#### EXECUTE_TOOL
Runs tool operations in flows, usually for AI-powered features.

#### EXECUTE_PROPERTY
Loads dynamic properties for pieces that need them at runtime.

#### EXECUTE_EXTRACT_PIECE_INFORMATION
Gets information about pieces when they're being installed or set up.

#### EXECUTE_VALIDATION
Checks that flow settings, inputs, or data are correct before running.

#### EXECUTE_TRIGGER_HOOK
Runs special logic before or after triggers fire.


<Info>
Failed jobs are not normal and need to be checked right away to find and fix what's causing them. 
They require immediate investigation as they represent executions that failed for unknown reasons that could indicate system issues.
</Info>

<Tip>
Delayed jobs represent either paused flows scheduled for future execution, upcoming polling job iterations, or jobs being retried due to temporary failures. They indicate an internal system error occurred and the job will be retried automatically according to the backoff policy.
