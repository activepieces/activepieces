Our infrastructure stack consists of several key components that help us monitor, deploy, and manage our services effectively.

## Hosting Providers

We use two main hosting providers:

- **DigitalOcean**: Hosts our databases including Redis and PostgreSQL
- **Hetzner**: Provides the machines that run our services

## Grafana (Loki) for Logs

We use Grafana Loki to collect and search through logs from all our services in one centralized place.

## Kamal for Deployment

Kamal is a deployment tool that helps us deploy our Docker containers to production with zero downtime.
