Our infrastructure stack includes several key components to monitor, deploy, and manage our services effectively.

## Hosting Providers

We use two main hosting providers:

- **DigitalOcean**: Hosts our databases including Redis and PostgreSQL.
- **Hetzner**: Provides the machines that run our services.

## Observability: Logs & Telemetry

We collect logs and telemetry from all services using **HyperDX**.

## Kamal for Deployment

We use **Kamal** as a deployment tool to deploy our Docker containers to production with zero downtime.
