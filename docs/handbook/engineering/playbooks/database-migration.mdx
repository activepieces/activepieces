Activepieces uses TypeORM as its database driver in Node.js. We support two database types across different editions of our platform.

The database migration files contain both what to do to migrate (up method) and what to do when rolling back (down method).

## Database Support

- PostgreSQL
- SQLite

<Tip>
**Why Do we have SQLite?**
We support SQLite to simplify development and self-hosting. It's particularly helpful for:

- Developers creating pieces who want a quick setup
- Self-hosters using platforms to manage docker images but doesn't support docker compose.
</Tip>

## Editions

- **Enterprise & Cloud Edition** (Must use PostgreSQL)
- **Community Edition** (Can use PostgreSQL or SQLite)

<Tip>
If you are generating a migration for an entity that will only be used in Cloud & Enterprise editions, you only need to create the PostgreSQL migration file. You can skip generating the SQLite migration.
</Tip>


### How To Generate

<Steps>
  <Step title="Uncomment Database Connection Export">
    Uncomment the following line in `packages/server/api/src/app/database/database-connection.ts`:
    ```typescript
    export const exportedConnection = databaseConnection()
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Database Type">
    Edit your `.env` file to set the database type:

    ```env
    # For SQLite migrations (default)
    AP_DATABASE_TYPE=SQLITE
    ```

    For PostgreSQL migrations:
    ```env
    AP_DATABASE_TYPE=POSTGRES
    AP_POSTGRES_DATABASE=activepieces
    AP_POSTGRES_HOST=db
    AP_POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    AP_POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
    AP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Migration">
    Run the migration generation command:
    ```bash
    nx db-migration server-api --name=<MIGRATION_NAME>
    ```
    Replace `<MIGRATION_NAME>` with a descriptive name for your migration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move Migration File">
    The command will generate a new migration file in `packages/server/api/src/app/database/migrations`. 
    Review the generated file and:

    - For PostgreSQL migrations: Move it to `postgres-connection.ts`
    - For SQLite migrations: Move it to `sqlite-connection.ts`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-comment Export">
    After moving the file, remember to re-comment the line from step 1:
    ```typescript
    // export const exportedConnection = databaseConnection()
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Always test your migrations by running them both up and down to ensure they work as expected.
