The on-call rotation is a simple strategy to ensure there is always someone available to fix the issue for the users, each engineer is responsible for a week and the rotation is done by the team.

## Why On-Call?

We need to ensure there is **exactly one person** at the same time who is the main point of contact for the users and the **first responder** for the issues. It's also a great way to learn about the product and the users and have some fun.

<Tip>
You can listen to [Queen - Under Pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I) while on-call, it's fun and motivating.

<Tip>
If you ever feel burn out in middle of your rotation, please reach out to the team and we will help you with the rotation or take over the responsibility.

## When you are on-call

The primary objective of being on-call is to triage issues and assist users. It is not about fixing the issues or coding missing features. Delegation is key whenever possible.

You are responsible for the following:

- Respond to Slack messages as soon as possible, referring to the [customer support guidelines](./customer-support.mdx).
- Check [community.activepieces.com](https://community.activepieces.com) for any new issues or to learn about existing issues.

<Tip>
**Friendly Tip #1**: always escalate to the team if you are unsure what to do.
