## Key features

### Open Ecosystem

You can create your own piece using a TypeScript framework that ensures strict typing. After developing these pieces, you can test them on your computer and then publish them as npm packages. Finally, you can import them into the visual builder.

The visual builder as well provides native support for TypeScript code and npm packages.
