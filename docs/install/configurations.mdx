To configure activepieces, you will need to set some environment variables, There is file called `docker-compose.yml` at the root directory for our main repo.

<Tip>
When you execute the deploy.sh script in the Docker installation tutorial, it will produce these values.

<Warning>
The frontend URL is essential for webhooks and app triggers to work. 
It must be accessible to third parties to send data. 
</Warning>

### Setting Webhook (Frontend URL):

The default URL is set to the machine's IP address. To ensure proper operation, ensure that this address is accessible or specify an `AP_FRONTEND_URL` environment variable.

One possible solution for this is using a service like ngrok (https://ngrok.com/), which can be used to expose the frontend port (4200) to the internet.


### Setting Sandbox mode:

There are two modes of execution for the activepieces: the default sandboxed mode and the non-sandboxed mode.

The sandboxed mode runs the code inside an isolated sandbox, and requires privileged access to Docker.

The non-sandboxed mode runs the code directly on the host machine without any restrictions. This mode doesn't require privileged access to Docker, but it should only be used with single trusted user in activepieces.


### Setting Notification for Failed Runs:

To get notified when a flow execution fails outside of testing, set a URL for `AP_NOTIFICATION_URL`.

To make a personalized notification channel, use activepieces to create a flow with a webhook trigger and choose your notification preference (e.g. Slack, Email). Copy the webhook URL and set it for `AP_NOTIFICATION_URL`.

Here's an example payload send by activepieces:

```json
{
  "body": {
    "type": "run.failed",
    "payload": {
      "run": {
        "id": "0km7v4Ke44TgEtA3HUnts",
