<Info>

</Info>

In this section, we will go through the checklist after using one of the installation methods and ensure that your deployment is production-ready.

<Accordion title="Decide on Sandboxing" icon="code">

You should decide on the sandboxing mode for your deployment based on your use case and whether it is multi-tenant or not. Here is a simplified way to decide:

<Tip>
**Friendly Tip #1**: For multi-tenant setups, use V8/Code Sandboxing. 

It is secure and does not require privileged Docker access in Kubernetes. 
Privileged Docker is usually not allowed to prevent root escalation threats.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Friendly Tip #2**: For single-tenant setups, use No Sandboxing. It is faster and does not require privileged Docker access.
</Tip>

<Accordion title="Enterprise Edition (Optional)" icon="building">
<Tip>
For licensing inquiries regarding the self-hosted enterprise edition, please reach out to `sales@activepieces.com`, as the code and Docker image are not covered by the MIT license.
</Tip>

<Note>You can request a trial key from within the app or in the cloud by filling out the form. Alternatively, you can contact sales at [https://www.activepieces.com/sales](https://www.activepieces.com/sales).<br></br>Please know that when your trial runs out, all enterprise [features](https://www.activepieces.com/pricing) will be shut down meaning any user other than the platform admin will be deactivated, and your private pieces will be deleted, which could result in flows using them to fail.</Note>

<Warning>
Before version 0.73.0, you cannot switch from CE to EE directly We suggest upgrading to 0.73.0 with the same edition first, then switch `AP_EDITION`.
</Warning>

<Warning>
Enterprise edition must use `PostgreSQL` as the database backend and `Redis` as the Queue System.
</Warning>

## Installation

1. Set the `AP_EDITION` environment variable to `ee`.
2. Set the `AP_EXECUTION_MODE` to anything other than `UNSANDBOXED`, check the above section.
3. Once your instance is up, activate the license key by going to **Platform Admin -> Setup -> License Keys**.

<Accordion title="Setup HTTPS" icon="lock">
Setting up HTTPS is highly recommended because many services require webhook URLs to be secure (HTTPS). This helps prevent potential errors.

To set up SSL, you can use any reverse proxy. For a step-by-step guide, check out our example using [Nginx](../guides/setup-ssl).
