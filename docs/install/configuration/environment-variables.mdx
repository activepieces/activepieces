To configure activepieces, you will need to set some environment variables, There is file called `.env` at the root directory for our main repo.

<Tip> When you execute the [tools/deploy.sh](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/tools/deploy.sh) script in the Docker installation tutorial, 
it will produce these values. </Tip>

<Warning>
  The frontend URL is essential for webhooks and app triggers to work. It must
  be accessible to third parties to send data.
</Warning>


### Setting Webhook (Frontend URL):

The default URL is set to the machine's IP address. To ensure proper operation, ensure that this address is accessible or specify an `AP_FRONTEND_URL` environment variable.

One possible solution for this is using a service like ngrok ([https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)), which can be used to expose the frontend port (4200) to the internet.

### Setting Piece Source

These are the different options for the `AP_PIECES_SOURCE` environment variable:

1. `FILE`: **Only for Local Development**, this option loads pieces directly from local files. For Production, please consider using other options, as this one only supports a single version per piece.

2. `DB`: This option will only load pieces that are manually installed in the database from "My Pieces" or the Admin Console in the EE Edition. Pieces are loaded from npm, which provides multiple versions per piece, making it suitable for production.

You can also set AP_PIECES_SYNC_MODE to `OFFICIAL_AUTO`, where it will update the metadata of pieces periodically.

### Redis Configuration

Set the `AP_REDIS_URL` environment variable to the connection URL of your Redis server. 

Please note that if a Redis connection URL is specified, all other **Redis properties** will be ignored.

<Info>
If you don't have the Redis URL, you can use the following command to get it. You can use the following variables:

- `REDIS_USER`: The username to use when connecting to Redis.
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: The password to use when connecting to Redis.
- `REDIS_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the Redis server.
- `REDIS_PORT`: The port number for the Redis server.
- `REDIS_DB`: The Redis database index to use.
- `REDIS_USE_SSL`: Connect to Redis with SSL.
</Info>
<Info>
  If you are using **Redis Sentinel**, you can set the following environment variables:
  - `AP_REDIS_TYPE`: Set this to `SENTINEL`.
  - `AP_REDIS_SENTINEL_HOSTS`: A comma-separated list of `host:port` pairs for Redis Sentinels. When set, all other Redis properties will be ignored.
  - `AP_REDIS_SENTINEL_NAME`: The name of the master node monitored by the sentinels.
  - `AP_REDIS_SENTINEL_ROLE`: The role to connect to, either `master` or `slave`.
  - `AP_REDIS_PASSWORD`: The password to use when connecting to Redis.
  - `AP_REDIS_USE_SSL`: Connect to Redis with SSL.
  - `AP_REDIS_SSL_CA_FILE`: The path to the CA file for the Redis server.
