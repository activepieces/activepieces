## Overview

If you see `(truncated)` in the flow run logs, it means the logs have exceeded the maximum allowed file size.

## How It Works

There is a current limitation where the log file of a run cannot grow past a certain size. When this limit is reached, the engine automatically removes the largest keys in the JSON output until it fits within the allowed size.

<Note>
**This does not affect flow execution.** Your flow will continue to run normally even when logs are truncated.
</Note>

## Known Limitation

There is one known issue with truncated logs:

If you **pause** a flow, then **resume** it, and the resumed step references data from a truncated step, the flow will fail because the referenced data is no longer available in the logs.

## Solution

You can increase the `AP_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` environment variable to a higher value to allow larger log files:

```bash
AP_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=50
```

<Info>
**Future Improvement:** There is a planned enhancement to change this limit from per-log-file to per-step, which will provide more granular control over log sizes. This feature is currently in the planning phase.
