If you forgot your password on a self-hosted instance, you can reset it using the following steps:

1. **Locate PostgreSQL Docker Container**:
   - Use a command like `docker ps` to find the PostgreSQL container.

2. **Access the Container**:
   - Use SSH to access the PostgreSQL Docker container.
   ```bash
   docker exec -it POSTGRES_CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash
   ```

3. **Open the PostgreSQL Console**:
   - Inside the container, open the PostgreSQL console with the `psql` command.
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   ```

4. **Connect to the ActivePieces Database**:
   - Connect to the ActivePieces database.
   ```sql
   \c activepieces
   ```

5. **Create a Secure Password**:
   - Use a tool like [bcrypt-generator.com](https://bcrypt-generator.com/) to generate a new secure password, number of rounds is 10.

6. **Update Your Password**:
   - Run the following SQL query within the PostgreSQL console, replacing `HASH_PASSWORD` with your new password and `YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS` with your email.
   ```sql
   UPDATE public.user_identity SET password='HASH_PASSWORD' WHERE email='YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS';
   ```
