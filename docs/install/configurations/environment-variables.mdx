  The frontend URL is essential for webhooks and app triggers to work. It must
  be accessible to third parties to send data.

### Seperate Workers from api

To separate workers from API servers, you can achieve this by setting `AP_FLOW_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` to zero on API servers, while keeping it on worker servers.

### Enabling Sign-Up:

To enable the sign-up feature, you need to ensure the code runs safely on the machine, especially if you don't trust the users. Follow these two steps:

1.  Make the Docker container privileged: Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and add `privileged: true`. This allows the container to have additional permissions to sandbox.
2.  Change the execution mode to sandboxing: Modify the `AP_EXECUTION_MODE` setting to `SANDBOXED`. This ensures the code runs within a secure environment, isolated from the rest of the system.
3.  Modify the `AP_SIGN_UP_ENABLED` to true , the environment variable.

### Enable Code Generator

To enable the code generator button, please provide a value for the `AP_OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

### Setting Webhook (Frontend URL):

The default URL is set to the machine's IP address. To ensure proper operation, ensure that this address is accessible or specify an `AP_FRONTEND_URL` environment variable.

One possible solution for this is using a service like ngrok ([https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/)), which can be used to expose the frontend port (4200) to the internet.

### Setting Piece Source

These are the different options for the `AP_PIECES_SOURCE` environment variable:

1. `FILE`: **Only for Local Development**, this option loads pieces directly from local files. For Production, please consider using other options, as this one only supports a single version per piece.

2. `DB`: This option will only load pieces that are manually installed in the database from "My Pieces" or the Admin Console in the EE Edition. Pieces are loaded from npm, which provides multiple versions per piece, making it suitable for production.

3. `CLOUD_AND_DB`: (Default) This option loads piece metadata from the cloud endpoint (https://cloud.activepieces.com/api/v1/pieces) and `DB`. Pieces are loaded from npm, which offers multiple versions per piece, making it suitable for production.
