Certain apps like Slack and Square only support one webhook per OAuth2 app. This means that manual configuration is required in their developer portal, and it cannot be automated.

## Slack

**Configure Webhook Secret**

1. Visit the "Basic Information" section of your Slack OAuth settings.
2. Copy the "Signing Secret" and save it.
3. Set the following environment variable in your activepieces environment: 
    ```
    AP_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRETS={"@activepieces/piece-slack": {"webhookSecret": "SIGNING_SECRET"}}
    ```
4. Restart your application instance.


**Configure Webhook URL**

1. Go to the "Event Subscription" settings in the Slack OAuth2 developer platform.
2. The URL format should be: `https://YOUR_AP_INSTANCE/api/v1/app-events/slack`.
3. When connecting to Slack, use your OAuth2 credentials or update the OAuth2 app details from the admin console (in platform plans).
