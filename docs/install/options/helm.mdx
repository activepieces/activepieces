This guide walks you through deploying Activepieces on Kubernetes using the official Helm chart.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.19+)
- Helm 3.x installed
- kubectl configured to access your cluster

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces.git
cd activepieces
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
helm dependency update
```

### 3. Create a Values File

Create a `my-values.yaml` file with your configuration. You can use the [example values file](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/blob/main/deploy/activepieces-helm/values.yaml) as a reference.
The Helm chart has sensible defaults for required values while leaving the optional ones empty, but you should customize these core values for production


### 4. Install Activepieces

```bash
helm install activepieces deploy/activepieces-helm -f my-values.yaml
```

### 5. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

```

## Production Checklist

- [ ] Set `frontendUrl` to your actual domain
- [ ] Set strong passwords for PostgreSQL and Redis (or keep auto-generated)
- [ ] Configure proper ingress with TLS
- [ ] Set appropriate resource limits
- [ ] Configure persistent storage
- [ ] Choose appropriate [execution mode](/docs/install/architecture/workers) for your security requirements
- [ ] Review [environment variables](/docs/install/configuration/environment-variables) for advanced configuration
- [ ] Consider using a [separate workers](/docs/install/configuration/separate-workers) setup for better availability and security

## Upgrading

```bash
# Update dependencies
helm dependency update

# Upgrade release
helm upgrade activepieces deploy/activepieces-helm -f my-values.yaml

# Check upgrade status
kubectl rollout status deployment/activepieces
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Pod won't start**: Check logs with `kubectl logs deployment/activepieces`
2. **Database connection**: Verify PostgreSQL credentials and connectivity
3. **Frontend URL**: Ensure `frontendUrl` is accessible from external sources
4. **Webhooks not working**: Check ingress configuration and DNS resolution

### Useful Commands

```bash
# View logs
kubectl logs deployment/activepieces -f

# Port forward for testing
kubectl port-forward svc/activepieces 4200:80 --namespace default

# Get all resources
kubectl get all --namespace default
```

## Editions

Activepieces supports three editions:

- **`ce` (Community Edition)**: Open-source version with all core features (default)
- **`ee` (Enterprise Edition)**: Self-hosted edition with advanced features like SSO, RBAC, and audit logs
- **`cloud`**: For Activepieces Cloud deployments

Set the edition in your values file:

```yaml
activepieces:
  edition: "ce"  # or "ee" for Enterprise Edition
```

For Enterprise Edition features and licensing, visit [activepieces.com](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/admin-console/overview).

## Environment Variables

For a complete list of configuration options, see the [Environment Variables](/docs/install/configuration/environment-variables) documentation. Most environment variables can be configured through the Helm values file under the `activepieces` section.

## Execution Modes

Understanding execution modes is crucial for security and performance. See the [Workers & Sandboxing](/docs/install/architecture/workers) guide to choose the right mode for your deployment.

## Uninstalling

```bash
helm uninstall activepieces

# Clean up persistent volumes (optional)
kubectl delete pvc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=activepieces
```
