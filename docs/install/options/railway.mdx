## What Gets Deployed

The Railway template deploys Activepieces with the following components:

- **Activepieces Application**: The main Activepieces container running the latest version from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/activepieces/activepieces)
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Managed PostgreSQL database for storing flows, executions, and application data
- **Redis Cache**: Redis instance for job queuing and caching (optional, can use in-memory cache)
- **Automatic SSL**: Railway provides automatic HTTPS with SSL certificates
- **Custom Domain Support**: Configure your own domain through Railway's dashboard

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

- A [Railway account](https://railway.app/) (free tier available)
- Basic understanding of environment variables (optional, for advanced configuration)

## Quick Start

1. **Click the deploy button** above to open Railway's deployment interface
2. **Configure environment variables for advanced usage** (see [Configuration](#configuration) below)
3. **Deploy** - Railway will automatically provision resources and start your instance

Once deployed, Railway will provide you with a public URL where your Activepieces instance is accessible.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Railway allows you to configure Activepieces through environment variables. You can set these in the Railway dashboard under your project's **Variables** tab.

#### Execution Mode

Configure the execution mode for security and performance:
See the [Workers & Sandboxing](/install/architecture/workers) documentation for details on each mode.

#### Other Important Variables

- `AP_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`: Enable/disable telemetry (default: `false`)

For a complete list of all available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables](/install/configuration/environment-variables) documentation.

## Custom Domain Setup

Railway supports custom domains with automatic SSL:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Networking**
3. Add your custom domain
4. Update `AP_FRONTEND_URL` environment variable to match your custom domain
5. Railway will automatically provision SSL certificates

For more details on SSL configuration, see the [Setup SSL](/install/guides/setup-ssl) guide.

## Production Considerations

Before deploying to production, review these important points:

- [ ] Review [Security Practices](/admin-guide/security/practices) documentation
- [ ] Configure `AP_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` based on your workload and hardware resources
- [ ] Ensure PostgreSQL backups are configured in Railway
- [ ] Consider database scaling options in Railway

## Observability

Railway provides built-in observability features for Activepieces. You can view logs and metrics in the Railway dashboard.

## Upgrading

To upgrade to a new version of Activepieces on Railway:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Deployments**
3. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
4. Railway will pull the latest Activepieces image and redeploy

<Warning>
Before upgrading, review the [Breaking Changes](/install/configuration/breaking-changes) documentation to ensure compatibility with your flows and configuration.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

After deploying Activepieces on Railway:

1. **Access your instance** using the Railway-provided URL
2. **Create your first flow** - see [Building Flows](/flows/building-flows)
3. **Configure webhooks** - see [Setup App Webhooks](/install/guides/setup-app-webhooks)
4. **Explore pieces** - browse available integrations in the piece library
