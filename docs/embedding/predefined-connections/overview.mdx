- When you are embedding Activepieces into your own SaaS and have [built](/developers/building-pieces/overview) your own piece,
 you might not want your user to re-enter authentication credentials inside Activepieces again, this section of the docs will help you solve this issue.

- In the following sections, we will talk about how to create global connections, hide the connections dropdown in the piece settings in the UI and how to fetch global connections inside a piece without asking for user input.

- We decided to call this "predefined", because the global connection would be created and provided to the user project before [provisioning the user](../provision-users).

- This is a new section in our docs, feel free to give us feedback on it on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/fA8hYBFkHd) or at [https://feedback.activepieces.com/](https://feedback.activepieces.com/)
