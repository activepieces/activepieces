## Prerequisites
<Steps>

<Step title="Start the devcontainer">
 Follow the documentation [here](/developers/development-setup/dev-container) to do so.
</Step>

<Step title="Set Your Environment Variables">
Update your packages/server-api/.env file to include:
```bash
## these variables are set to align with the .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml file
AP_DB_TYPE=POSTGRES
AP_DEV_PIECES="your_piece_name"
AP_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
AP_EDITION=ee
AP_EXECUTION_MODE=SANDBOXED
AP_FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:4200"
AP_WEBHOOK_URL="http://localhost:3000"
AP_PIECES_SOURCE='FILE'
AP_PIECES_SYNC_MODE='NONE'
AP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
AP_LOG_PRETTY=true
AP_QUEUE_MODE=REDIS
AP_REDIS_HOST="redis"
AP_REDIS_PORT="6379"
AP_TRIGGER_DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL=1
AP_CACHE_PATH=/workspace/cache
AP_POSTGRES_DATABASE=activepieces
AP_POSTGRES_HOST=db
AP_POSTGRES_PORT=5432
AP_POSTGRES_USERNAME=postgres
AP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD=A79Vm5D4p2VQHOp2gd5
```
</Step>



<Step title="Activate Your License Key">
After signing in, activate the license key by going to **Platform Admin -> Setup -> License Keys**
![Activation License Key](/resources/screenshots/activation-license-key-settings.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Create Your Piece">

Follow the instructions [here](/developers/building-pieces/overview) to create your piece, after that come back here to customize the piece logic to use predefined connections.
</Step>
</Steps>
## Implementation

<Steps>
 
  <Step title="Set Project External ID">
    Go to your **Project Settings** and set the external Id to something specific like `xyz`:
    ![Project Settings](/resources/screenshots/project-settings.png)    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Global Connection">
    <Tip>We recommend creating global connections because only platform admins can delete or edit them, so your user can never delete the connection. </Tip>
    Create a global connection by going to **Platform Admin -> Setup -> Global Connections** and set the external ID to something like `gelato_xyz`:
     ![Global Connections](/resources/screenshots/create-global-connection.png)    
     <Tip>You can only edit the external ID when creating the connection, and to view the external id of the connection, just hover its name in the table.</Tip> 
  </Step>
   <Step title="Don't Ask for Authentication in Your Actions/Triggers">
    After you have created your [piece definition](../developers/building-pieces/piece-definition) and added [its authentication](../developers/building-pieces/piece-authentication).
    Once you are [creating an action](../developers/building-pieces/create-action) or a [trigger](..developers/building-pieces/create-trigger), you can set the param `requireAuth` to be false in the `createAction` or `createTrigger` methods.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch Connections to Use in Actions/Triggers">
    Let's suppose the predefined connection externalId you want to store is **gelato_projectExternalId**, now in **run/test** method of your action or trigger, or the **onEnable/onDisable/onRenew** methods in your trigger, you can fetch the connection like this:
   ```ts
import { ConnectionsManager, Property, TriggerStrategy } from "@activepieces/pieces-framework";
import { createTrigger } from "@activepieces/pieces-framework";
import { AppConnectionType, AppConnectionValue, isNil } from "@activepieces/shared";



const fetchConnection = async<T extends AppConnectionType> (connections: ConnectionsManager, projectExternalId: string | undefined): Promise<AppConnectionValue<T>> => {
if (isNil(projectExternalId)) {
 throw new Error('Project external ID is required');
}
const connection = await connections.get(`gelato_${projectExternalId}`);
if (isNil(connection)) {
 throw new Error(`Connection not found for project ${projectExternalId}`);
}
return connection as AppConnectionValue<T>;
}

export const newFlavorCreated = createTrigger({
 requireAuth:false,
 name: 'newFlavorCreated',
 displayName: 'new flavor created',
 description: 'triggers when a new icecream flavor is created.',
 props: {
    dropdown: Property.Dropdown({
        displayName: 'Dropdown',
        required: true,
        refreshers: [],
        options: async (_, {connections,project}) => {
            const connection = await fetchConnection<AppConnectionType.CUSTOM_AUTH>(connections, (await project.externalId()));
            // your logic
            return {
                options: [{
                    label: 'test',
                    value: 'test'
                }]
            }
        }
    })
 },
 sampleData: {},
 type: TriggerStrategy.POLLING,
 async test({connections, project}) {
       const connection = await fetchConnection<AppConnectionType.CUSTOM_AUTH>(connections, (await project.externalId()));
 // use the connection with your own logic
    return []
 },
 async onEnable({connections, project}) {
 	   const connection = await fetchConnection<AppConnectionType.CUSTOM_AUTH>(connections, (await project.externalId()));
 // use the connection with your own logic
 },

 async onDisable({connections, project}) {
 	   const connection = await fetchConnection<AppConnectionType.CUSTOM_AUTH>(connections, (await project.externalId()));
 // use the connection with your own logic
 },

 async run({connections, project}) {
     const connection = await fetchConnection<AppConnectionType.CUSTOM_AUTH>(connections, (await project.externalId()));
   // use the connection with your own logic
    return []
 },
 });
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your Piece"> 
    Create a flow in your project and add a step from your piece and test it, you should see it working correctly.
  </Step>
