Update your packages/server-api/.env file to include:
```bash
## these variables are set to align with the .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml file
AP_DB_TYPE=POSTGRES
AP_DEV_PIECES="your_piece_name"
AP_ENVIRONMENT="dev"
AP_EDITION=ee

```
</Step>



<Step title="Activate Your License Key">
After signing in, activate the license key by going to **Platform Admin -> Setup -> License Keys**

</Step>

<Step title="Create Your Piece">

Follow the instructions [here](/developers/building-pieces/overview) to create your piece
</Step>
</Steps>
## Implementation

<Steps>
 
  <Step title="Set Project External ID">
    Go to your **Project Settings** and set the external Id to something specific like `xyz`:
    ![Project Settings](/resources/screenshots/project-settings.png)    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Global Connection">
    <Tip>We recommend creating global connections because only platform admins can delete or edit them, so your user can never delete the connection. </Tip>
    Create a global connection by going to **Platform Admin -> Setup -> Global Connections** and set the external ID to something like `gelato_xyz`:
     ![Global Connections](/resources/screenshots/create-global-connection.png)    
  </Step>
   <Step title="Don't Ask for Authentication in Your Actions/Triggers">
    After you have created your [piece definition](../developers/building-pieces/piece-definition) and added [its authentication](../developers/building-pieces/piece-authentication).
    Once you are [creating an action](../developers/building-pieces/create-action) or a [trigger](..developers/building-pieces/create-trigger), you can set the param `requireAuth` to be false in the `createAction` or `createTrigger` methods.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch Connections to Use in Actions/Triggers">
    Let's suppose the predefined connection externalId you want to store is **gelato_projectExternalId**, now in **run/test** method of your action or trigger, or the **onEnable/onDisable/onRenew** methods in your trigger, you can fetch the connection like this:
   ```ts
import { PieceAuth, Property, TriggerStrategy } from "@activepieces/pieces-framework";
import { createTrigger } from "@activepieces/pieces-framework";
import { isNil } from "@activepieces/shared";
//Your piece authentication property (if you placed it in piece definition file)
import { auth } from '../../index';


const fetchConnection = async (connections: ConnectionsManager, projectExternalId: string | undefined) => {
  if (!projectExternalId) {
    throw new Error('Project external ID is required');
  }
  const connection = await connections.get(`gelato-${projectExternalId}`);
  if (!connection) {
    throw new Error(`Connection not found for project ${projectExternalId}`);
  }
  return connection;
}
export const newFlavorCreated = createTrigger({
    requireAuth:false,
	auth,
    name: 'newFlavorCreated',
    displayName: 'new flavor created',
    description: 'triggers when a new icecream flavor is created.',
    props: {},
    sampleData: {},
    type: TriggerStrategy.POLLING,
    async test({connections, project}) {
	      const connection = await fetchConnection(connections, (await project.externalId()));
    // use the connection with your own logic
	   return []
    },
    async onEnable({connections, project}) {
		   const connection = await fetchConnection(connections, (await project.externalId()));
    // use the connection with your own logic
    },

    async onDisable({connections, project}) {
		   const connection = await fetchConnection(connections, (await project.externalId()));
    // use the connection with your own logic
    },

    async run({connections, project}) {
        const connection = await fetchConnection(connections, (await project.externalId()));
      // use the connection with your own logic
	   return []
    },
    });
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your Piece"> 
    Create a flow in your project and add a step from your piece and test it, you should see it working correctly.
  </Step>
