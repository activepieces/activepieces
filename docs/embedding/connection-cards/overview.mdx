This feature enables you to gather user credentials in your platform with embedable widget without granting them access to Activepieces, for example your product aims to send notifications to your customers' Slack workspaces.

By utilizing our JavaScript SDK, you can easily add connection cards into your SaaS platform. This allows you to create customized automations on behalf of your users.

## How It Works

Here's a simple breakdown of how this feature works:

1. Copy the provided JS SDK into your platform.
2. When a user successfully connects, their connection information will be available in your Activepieces account.
3. You can dynamically utilize this information within your workflow.
4. We've also developed additional tools and pieces that allow you to run the same flow for multiple users.
