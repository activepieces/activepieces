<Warning>
**Breaking Change**: <br/> If your Activepieces image version is < 0.45.0 and (you are using the connect method from the embed SDk, and need the connection externalId to be returned after the user creates it OR if you want to reconnect a specific connection with an externalId), you must upgrade your Activepieces image to >= 0.45.0
</Warning>

<Warning> 
 Between Acitvepieces image version 0.32.1 and 0.46.4 the navigation handler was including the project id in the path, this might have broken implementation logic for people using the navigation handler, this has been fixed from 0.46.5 and onwards, the handler won't show the project id prepended to routes.
</Warning>

Change log format: DD/MM/YYYY (version)

### 04/12/2024 (0.3.0)

<Warning>
**Breaking Change**: Automatic URL sync has been removed. Instead, Activepieces now provides a callback handler method. Please read [Embedding Navigation](./navigation) for more information.
</Warning>

- add custom navigation handler ([#4500](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/pull/4500))
- allow passing a predefined name for connection in connect method ([#4485](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/pull/4485))
- add changelog ([#4503](https://github.com/activepieces/activepieces/pull/4503))


### 26/01/2025 (0.3.3)

- This version requires you to update Activepieces to 0.39.8
- activepieces.configure method was being resolved before the user was authenticated, this is fixed now, so you can use activepieces.navigate method to navigate to your desired initial route.


### 04/02/2025 (0.3.4)

- This version requires you to update Activepieces to 0.41.0
- Adds the ability to pass font family name and font url to the embed sdk


### 24/2/2025 (0.3.5)
- Added a new parameter to the connect method to make the connection dialog a popup instead of an iframe taking the full page.
- Fixed a bug where the returned promise from the connect method was always resolved to \{connection: undefined\}
- Now when you use the connect method with the "connectionName" parameter, the user will reconnect to the connection with the matching externalId instead of creating a new one.


### 16/04/2025 (0.3.6)
- Added the [request](./sdk-server-requests) method which allows you to call our backend API.

### 17/04/2025 (0.3.7)
- Added [MCP methods](./mcps) to update MCP configurations.


### 20/05/2025 (0.4.0)

-- Note: we didn't consider adding optional new parameters as a breaking change so we were bumping the patch version, but that was wrong and we will begin bumping the minor version for those changes from now on, and patch version will only get bumped for bug fixes.
- This version requires you to update Activepieces to 0.56.0
- Added `embedding.hideExportAndImportFlow` parameter to the [configure](./embed-builder) method.
- Added new possible value to the configure method param `embed.builder.disableNavigation` which is "keep_home_button_only" that keeps only the home button and hides the folder name with the delete flow action. 
- Added new param to the configure method `embed.builder.homeButtonClickedHandler`, that overrides the navigation behaviour on clicking the home button.
