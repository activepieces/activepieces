<Warning>
**Breaking Change**: <br/> If your Activepieces instance version is < 0.45.0 and (you are using the connect method from the embed sdk, and need the connection externalId to be returned after the user creates it OR if you want to reconnect a specific connection with an externalId), you must upgrade your instance to >= 0.45.0
</Warning>


### 02/24/2025 (3.0.5)
- Added a new parameter to the connect method to make the connection dialog a popup instead of an iframe taking the full page.
- Fixed a bug where the returned promise from the connect method was always resolved to \{connection: undefined\}
- Now when you use the connect method with the "connectionName" parameter, the user will reconnect to the connection with the matching externalId instead of creating a new one.

### 02/04/2025 (3.0.4)

- This version requires you to update Activepieces to 0.41.0
- Adds the ability to pass font family name and font url to the embed sdk

### 01/26/2025 (3.0.3)

- This version requires you to update Activepieces to 0.39.8
- activepieces.configure method was being resolved before the user was authenticated, this is fixed now, so you can use activepieces.navigate method to navigate to your desired initial route.


### 12/04/2024 (3.0)
