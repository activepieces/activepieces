This documentation explains how to embed the Activepieces iframe inside your application and customize it.

## Configure SDK

Adding the embedding SDK script will initialize an object in your window called `activepieces`, which has a method called `configure` that you should call after the container has been rendered.
<Tip>
The following scripts shouldn't contain the `async` or `defer` attributes.
</Tip>


<Tip>
These steps assume you have already generated a JWT token from the backend. If not, please check the [provision-users](./provision-users) page.
</Tip>

```html
<script src="https://cdn.activepieces.com/sdk/embed/0.3.0.js">
</script>
<script>
activepieces.configure({
  prefix: "/",
  instanceUrl: 'INSTANCE_URL',
  jwtToken: "GENERATED_JWT_TOKEN",
  embedding: {
    containerId: "container",
    builder: {
      disableNavigation: false,
      hideLogo: false,
      hideFlowName: false
    },
    dashboard: {
      hideSidebar: false
    },
    hideFolders: false,
    navigation: {
      handler: ({ route }) => {
          // The iframe route has changed, make sure you check the navigation section.
        }
    }
  },
});

</script>
```
<Tip>
`configure` returns a promise which is resolved after authentication is done.

 </Tip>

<Tip>
Please check the [navigation](./navigation.mdx) section, as it's very important to understand how navigation works and how to supply an auto-sync experience.
</Tip>
