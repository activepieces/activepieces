This documentation explains how to embed the Activepieces iframe inside your application and customize it.

## Configure SDK

Adding the embedding SDK script will initialize an object in your window called `activepieces`, which has a method called `configure` that you should call after the container has been rendered.
<Tip>
The following scripts shouldn't contain the `async` or `defer` attributes.
</Tip>


<Tip>
These steps assume you have already generated a JWT token from the backend. If not, please check the [provision-users](./provision-users) page.
</Tip>

```html
<script src="https://cdn.activepieces.com/sdk/embed/0.4.0.js">
</script>
<script>
const instanceUrl = 'YOUR_INSTANCE_URL';
const jwtToken = 'GENERATED_JWT_TOKEN';
const containerId = 'YOUR_CONTAINER_ID';
activepieces.configure({
  prefix: "/",
  instanceUrl,
  jwtToken,
  embedding: {
    containerId,
    builder: {
      disableNavigation: false,
      hideLogo: false,
      hideFlowName: false
    },
    dashboard: {
      hideSidebar: false
    },
    hideFolders: false,
    navigation: {
      handler: ({ route }) => {
          // The iframe route has changed, make sure you check the navigation section.
        }
    }
  },
});

</script>
```
<Tip>
`configure` returns a promise which is resolved after authentication is done.

 </Tip>

<Tip>
Please check the [navigation](./navigation) section, as it's very important to understand how navigation works and how to supply an auto-sync experience.
</Tip>

**Configure Parameters:**

| Parameter Name |  Required |  Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| prefix | ❌ | string | Some customers have an embedding prefix, like this `<embedding_url_prefix>/<Activepieces_url>`. For example if the prefix is `/automation` and the Activepieces url is `/flows` the full url would be `/automation/flows`. |
| instanceUrl| ✅ |  string | The url of the instance hosting Activepieces, could be https://cloud.activepieces.com if you are a cloud user. |

| embedding.dashboard.hideSidebar | ❌ | boolean | Controls the visibility of the sidebar in the dashboard, by default it is false. |
| embedding.hideFolders | ❌ | boolean | Hides all things related to folders in both the flows table and builder by default it is false. |
| embedding.styling.fontUrl | ❌ | string | The url of the font to be used in the embedding, by default it is `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@300;400;500;700&display=swap`. |

| navigation.handler  | ❌ | `({route:string}) => void`  | This callback will be triggered each time a route in Activepieces changes, you can read more about it [here](/embedding/navigation) |

<Tip>
 For the font to be loaded, you need to set both the `fontUrl` and `fontFamily` properties.
 If you only set one of them, the default font will be used.
 The default font is `Roboto`.
 The font weights we use are the default font-weights from [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-weight).
