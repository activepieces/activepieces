## Implementation
By default navigating within your embedded instance of Activepieces, doesn't affect the client's browser history or viewed url, however if you use the following snippet when configuring the sdk,
you will get the client's browser history and viewed url with Activepieces:
```js
 activepieces.configure( {
      prefix: "/",
      instanceUrl:'INSTANCE_URL',
      jwtToken:"GENERATED_JWT_TOKEN",
      embedding: {
        containerId: "container",
        builder:{
          disableNavigation:false,
          hideLogo: false,
          hideFlowName: false
        },
        dashboard: {
          hideSidebar:false
        },
        hideFolders:false,
        navigation:{
          handler: (result) => {
            if(!window.location.href.endsWith(result.route))
              {
                window.history.pushState({}, "", window.location.origin + result.route);
              }
          }
        }
      },   
   });

 window.addEventListener("popstate", () => {
    const route= activepieces.extractActivepiecesRouteFromUrl({vendorUrl: window.location.href});
    activepieces.navigate({route});
   });   
 ```
 You could implement your own custom logic using the navigation handler. 


## Navigate Method

If you use `activepieces.navigate({ route: '/flows' })` this will tell the embedded sdk where to navigate to.

Here is the list for routes the sdk can navigate to:

| Route | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/flows` | Flows table
| `/flows/{flowId}` | Opens up a flow in the builder
| `/runs` | Runs table
| `/runs/{runId}` | Opens up a run in the builder
| `/connections` | Connections table
