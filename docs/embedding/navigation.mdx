By default, navigating within your embedded instance of Activepieces doesn't affect the client's browser history or viewed URL. Activepieces only provide a **handler**, that trigger on every route change in the **iframe**.

## Automatically Sync URL 

You can use the following snippet when configuring the SDK, which will implement a handler that syncs the Activepieces iframe with your browser:

<Tip>
The following snippet listens when the user clicks backward, so it syncs the route back to the iframe using `activepieces.navigate` and in the handler, it updates the URL of the browser.
</Tip>

```js
activepieces.configure({
  prefix: "/",
  instanceUrl: 'INSTANCE_URL',
  jwtToken: "GENERATED_JWT_TOKEN",
  embedding: {
    containerId: "container",
    builder: {
      disableNavigation: false,
      hideLogo: false,
      hideFlowName: false
    },
    dashboard: {
      hideSidebar: false
    },
    hideFolders: false,
    navigation: {
      handler: ({ route }) => {
        if (!window.location.href.endsWith(route)) {
          window.history.pushState({}, "", window.location.origin + route);
        }
      }
    }
  },
});

window.addEventListener("popstate", () => {
  const route = activepieces.extractActivepiecesRouteFromUrl({ vendorUrl: window.location.href });
  activepieces.navigate({ route });
});
```
## Navigate Method

If you use `activepieces.navigate({ route: '/flows' })` this will tell the embedded sdk where to navigate to.

Here is the list for routes the sdk can navigate to:

| Route | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/flows` | Flows table
| `/flows/{flowId}` | Opens up a flow in the builder
| `/runs` | Runs table
| `/runs/{runId}` | Opens up a run in the builder
| `/connections` | Connections table
