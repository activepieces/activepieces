# Why Does Ensemble need data?

As a self-hosted product, gathering usage metrics and insights can be difficult for us. However, these analytics are essential in helping us understand key behaviors and delivering a higher quality experience that meets your needs.

To ensure we can continue to improve our product, we have decided to track certain basic behaviors and metrics that are vital for understanding the usage of Ensemble.

We have implemented a minimal tracking plan and provide a detailed list of the metrics collected in a separate section.


# What Does Ensemble Collect?

We value transparency in data collection and assure you that we do not collect any personal information. The following events are currently being collected:
