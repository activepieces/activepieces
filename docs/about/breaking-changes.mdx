## 0.38.6

### What has changed?

- Workers no longer rely on the `AP_FLOW_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` and `AP_SCHEDULED_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` environment variables. These values are now retrieved from the app server.

### When is action necessary?

- If `AP_CONTAINER_TYPE` is set to `WORKER` on the worker machine, and `AP_SCHEDULED_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` or `AP_FLOW_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` are set to zero on the app server, workers will stop processing the queues. To fix this, check the [Separate Worker from App](https://www.activepieces.com/docs/install/configuration/separate-workers) documentation and set the `AP_CONTAINER_TYPE` to fetch the necessary values from the app server. If no container type is set on the worker machine, this is not a breaking change.

## 0.35.1

### What has changed?

- The 'name' attribute has been renamed to 'externalId' in the `AppConnection` entity.
- The 'displayName' attribute has been added to the `AppConnection` entity.

### When is action necessary?
- If you are using the connections API, you should update the `name` attribute to `externalId` and add the `displayName` attribute.

## 0.35.0

### What has changed?

- All branches are now converted to routers, and downgrade is not supported.

## 0.33.0

### What has changed?

- Files from actions or triggers are now stored in the database / S3 to support retries from certain steps, and the size of files from actions is now subject to the limit of `AP_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`.
- Files in triggers were previously passed as base64 encoded strings; now they are passed as file paths in the database / S3. Paused flows that have triggers from version 0.29.0 or earlier will no longer work.

### When is action necessary?
- If you are dealing with large files in the actions, consider increasing the `AP_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` to a higher value, and make sure the storage system (database/S3) has enough capacity for the files.


## 0.30.0

### What has changed?

- `AP_SANDBOX_RUN_TIME_SECONDS` is now deprecated and replaced with `AP_FLOW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `AP_CODE_SANDBOX_TYPE` is now deprecated and replaced with new mode in `AP_EXECUTION_MODE`

### When is action necessary?

- If you are using `AP_CODE_SANDBOX_TYPE` to `V8_ISOLATE`, you should switch to `AP_EXECUTION_MODE` to `SANDBOX_CODE_ONLY`
- If you are using `AP_SANDBOX_RUN_TIME_SECONDS` to set the sandbox run time limit, you should switch to `AP_FLOW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`

## 0.28.0

### What has changed?

- **Project Members:**
    - The `EXTERNAL_CUSTOMER` role has been deprecated and replaced with the `OPERATOR` role. Please check the permissions page for more details.
    - All pending invitations will be removed.
    - The User Invitation entity has been introduced to send invitations. You can still use the Project Member API to add roles for the user, but it requires the user to exist. If you want to send an email, use the User Invitation, and later a record in the project member will be created after the user accepts and registers an account.
- **Authentication:**
    - The `SIGN_UP_ENABLED` environment variable, which allowed multiple users to sign up for different platforms/projects, has been removed. It has been replaced with inviting users to the same platform/project. All old users should continue to work normally.

### When is action necessary?

- **Project Members:**

If you use the embedding SDK or the create project member API with the `EXTERNAL_CUSTOMER` role, you should start using the `OPERATOR` role instead.

- **Authentication:**

Multiple platforms/projects are no longer supported in the community edition. Technically, everything is still there, but you have to hack using the API as the authentication system has now changed. If you have already created the users/platforms, they should continue to work, and no action is required.
