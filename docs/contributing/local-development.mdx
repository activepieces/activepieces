## Using Dev Containers in Visual Studio Code

The project includes a dev container configuration that allows you to use Visual Studio Code's [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension to develop the project in a consistent environment. This can be especially helpful if you are new to the project or if you have a different environment setup on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the dev container, you will need to install the following:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- The [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension for Visual Studio Code.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

## Using the Dev Container

To use the dev container for the Activepieces project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Activepieces repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
3. Press `Ctrl+P` and type `> Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.
4. Run `pnpm install && pnpm start`.
5. The backend will run at `localhost:3000` and the frontend will run at `localhost:4200`.

## Exiting the Dev Container

To exit the dev container and return to your local environment, follow these steps:

1. In the bottom left corner of Visual Studio Code, click the `Remote-Containers: Reopen folder locally` button.
2. Visual Studio Code will close the connection to the dev container and reopen the project in your local environment.
