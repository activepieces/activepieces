Flow hooks provide the ability to control the flow of execution from inside a piece. By using the `ctx` parameter in the `run` method of actions, you can perform various operations to control the flow.

## Stop Flow

You can stop the flow and provide a response to the webhook trigger, This can be useful when you want to terminate the execution of the piece and send a specific response back.

**Example with Response:**

```typescript
context.run.stop({
  response: {
    status: context.propsValue.status ?? StatusCodes.OK,
    body: context.propsValue.body,
    headers: (context.propsValue.headers as Record<string, string>) ?? {},
  },
});
```

**Example without Response:**

```typescript
context.run.stop();
```

## Pause / Delay Flow

You can pause or delay the flow until a specific timestamp. Currently, the only supported type of pause is a delay based on a future timestamp.

**Example:**

```typescript
ctx.run.pause({
    pauseMetadata: {
        type: PauseType.DELAY,
        resumeDateTime: futureTime.toUTCString()
    }
});
```

These flow hooks give you control over the execution of the piece by allowing you to stop the flow or pause it until a certain condition is met. You can use these hooks to customize the behavior and flow of your actions.
