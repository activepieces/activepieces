**Functional Requirements:**
* Create Flow Queue to add flow execution requests from multiple sources.
* Consume flow requests and executes flow using `engine`.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
* Securely execute untrusted code actions written by the user.
* Queue tasks should be durable, doesn't get lost after shutting down the server.
* The queue should be distributed to allow scaling worker horizontally.


**Terminology:**
* Flow Queue: contains flow execution requests from multiple sources.
* Flow Worker: consume flow queue and obtaining the flow results
* [BullMQ](https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq): distributed queue system based on `redis` as persistence layer.
* [Isolate](https://github.com/ioi/isolate): creates a lightweight sandboxes locally.


## Detailed Design

### Flow Queue

The flow queue is based on `BullMQ`, that would make it durable since it stores the tasks on `redis`
and the library also support repeatable tasks.

The repeatable tasks are required for flows with schedule trigger.

### Flow Worker

Consumes the flow queue and do the following in this order:

**1. Create Sandbox:**

First we need to decide which sandbox number to use locally, We have a singleton predefined queue contains all numbers from 1 to 20 (randomly picked),
We will pick the first element and remove it from queue and return it once we are done.

Next we will call isolate binary file to clean and initialize sandbox directory with picked number from the queue.

After that Isolate should creates an folder in the following path: `/var/local/lib/isolate/BOX_ID`.

**2. Download Required Files to Sandbox:**

Now we need to copy all required files to execute flow inside `/var/local/lib/isolate/BOX_ID/box`.

**Required files:**
* Flow Structure as json
* Collection Structure as Json
* Codes: Codes written by the user
* Engine: static bundled JS file from `engine` package.

In the following structure.
```
.
├── BOX_ID
│   ├── box
│   │   ├── activepieces-engine.js
│   │   ├── flows
│   │   │   │── flow_version_id.json
│   │   ├── collections
│   │   │   │── collection_version_id.json
│   │   ├── code
│   │   │   │── code_one_file_id.js
│   │   │   │── code_two_file_id.js

```

**3. Call The Engine:**

The worker will ask isolate to sandbox specified command line inside the folder with predefined limitation.

The command will look something similar to this.

`./isolate --box-id=%d --processes --wall-time=500 --run node /var/local/lib/isolate/BOX_ID/box/activepieces-engine.js`


**4. Parse the Result file:**

The engine will produce an output file `_output.json` inside the sandbox, the worker will parse this and upload the execution result.
