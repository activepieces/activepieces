# Engine

## Error Handling

- **Always throw `ExecutionError` subclasses** (from `@activepieces/shared`) instead of plain `Error`. The engine uses `tryCatchAndThrowOnEngineError` which only propagates errors of type `ExecutionErrorType.ENGINE` — plain `Error` instances are silently swallowed and treated as user-level failures.
- Use `EngineGenericError` for engine-level failures (e.g., failed API calls to the server).
- Use the existing specific error classes (`ConnectionNotFoundError`, `StorageLimitError`, `PausedFlowTimeoutError`, etc.) when applicable.
