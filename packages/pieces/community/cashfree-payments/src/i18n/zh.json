Sign in to your Cashfree account and open the *Payouts* dashboard.\n  2. In the navigation panel select **Developers**.\n  3. Click **API Keys**.\n  4. Click **Generate API Keys** on the API Keys screen.\n  5. The **New API Keys** popup displays the Client ID and Client Secret.\n  6. Click **Download API Keys** to save the keys locally. Keep these secret — do not share them.\n\n\n\n",
