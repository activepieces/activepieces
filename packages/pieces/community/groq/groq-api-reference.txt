Chat
Create chat completion
POST
https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions

Creates a model response for the given chat conversation.

Request Body
frequency_penalty
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

function_call
Deprecated
string / object or null
Optional
Deprecated in favor of tool_choice.

Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function.

none is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.

Show possible types
functions
Deprecated
array or null
Optional
Deprecated in favor of tools.

A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.

Show properties
logit_bias
object or null
Optional
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

logprobs
boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to false
This is not yet supported by any of our models. Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message.

max_completion_tokens
integer or null
Optional
The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.

max_tokens
Deprecated
integer or null
Optional
Deprecated in favor of max_completion_tokens. The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.

messages
array
Required
A list of messages comprising the conversation so far.

Show possible types
model
string
Required
ID of the model to use. For details on which models are compatible with the Chat API, see available models

n
integer or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that the current moment, only n=1 is supported. Other values will result in a 400 response.

parallel_tool_calls
boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to true
Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use.

presence_penalty
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

response_format
object or null
Optional
An object specifying the format that the model must output.

Setting to { "type": "json_object" } enables JSON mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.

Important: when using JSON mode, you must also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message.

Show properties
seed
integer or null
Optional
If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the system_fingerprint response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.

service_tier
string or null
Optional
The service tier to use for the request. Defaults to on_demand.

auto will automatically select the highest tier available within the rate limits of your organization.
flex uses the flex tier, which will succeed or fail quickly.
stop
string / array or null
Optional
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

Show possible types
stream
boolean or null
Optional
Defaults to false
If set, partial message deltas will be sent. Tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent events as they become available, with the stream terminated by a data: [DONE] message. Example code.

stream_options
object or null
Optional
Options for streaming response. Only set this when you set stream: true.

Show properties
temperature
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both

tool_choice
string / object or null
Optional
Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model. none means the model will not call any tool and instead generates a message. auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling one or more tools. required means the model must call one or more tools. Specifying a particular tool via {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}} forces the model to call that tool.

none is the default when no tools are present. auto is the default if tools are present.

Show possible types
tools
array or null
Optional
A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.

Show properties
top_logprobs
integer or null
Optional
This is not yet supported by any of our models. An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.

top_p
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

user
string or null
Optional
A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help us monitor and detect abuse.

Returns
Returns a chat completion object, or a streamed sequence of chat completion chunk objects if the request is streamed.

Audio
Create transcription
POST
https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions

Transcribes audio into the input language.

Request Body
file
string
Required
The audio file object (not file name) to transcribe, in one of these formats: flac, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, ogg, wav, or webm.

language
string
Optional
The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format will improve accuracy and latency.

model
string
Required
ID of the model to use. Only whisper-large-v3 is currently available.

prompt
string
Optional
An optional text to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.

response_format
string
Optional
Defaults to json
The format of the transcript output, in one of these options: json, text, or verbose_json.

temperature
number
Optional
Defaults to 0
The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.

timestamp_granularities[]
array
Optional
Defaults to segment
The timestamp granularities to populate for this transcription. response_format must be set verbose_json to use timestamp granularities. Either or both of these options are supported: word, or segment. Note: There is no additional latency for segment timestamps, but generating word timestamps incurs additional latency.

Returns
Returns an audio transcription object
