      To enable this trigger, connect your Retell AI agent with a webhook endpoint:

        Sign in to your Retell AI Dashboard
        .

        Open the Agents section and select the agent you want to track.

        In the agentâ€™s Settings, locate the Webhook URL field.

        Paste the following endpoint into the field:

        {{webhookUrl}}


        Save your changes.

        Once configured, Retell AI will automatically send call lifecycle events (such as call_started and call_ended) to this webhook. Your flow can then react dynamically to these events, and you can add filtering logic if you only want to handle specific event types.
