# Projects

A **Project** is the workspace within a platform where flows, connections, tables, and other resources live. Every platform has at least one, always scoped via `platformId`. CE gives a single user one personal project; the EE ee-projects module extends this with team projects, limits, and admin CRUD. All editions.

### Entity & terms
- `project` entity: `ownerId`, `platformId`, `displayName`, `type`, `icon` (jsonb `{ color }`), `externalId` (nullable, for embedding mapping), `maxConcurrentJobs` (nullable cap), `releasesEnabled`, `metadata`, `poolId` (FK concurrency_pool), `deleted` (soft-delete timestamp). Unique `(platformId, externalId)` where not deleted.
- **ProjectType**: `PERSONAL` (auto-created on signup, one per user per platform) or `TEAM` (EE multi-member).
- Relations (one-to-many): flows, files, folders, events, appConnections, tables, fields, records, cells, tableWebhooks.

### Service methods
- `create({ displayName, ownerId, platformId, type, callPostCreateHooks?, postCreateContext?, ... })` — random icon color, fires `projectHooks.postCreate`. `postCreateContext` carries `alertReceiverEmail` for auto-subscribing an alert receiver on team projects.
- `update` — TEAM allows `displayName` + `icon`; PERSONAL allows neither.
- `getOne`/`getOneOrThrow`, `getAllForUser` (admins see all platform projects, members see assigned), `getUserProjectOrThrow` (CE list), `getProjectIdsByPlatform`, `countByPlatformIdAndType` (limit enforcement).

### Endpoints (CE level)
- `GET /v1/projects` — CE returns personal project only.
- `GET /v1/projects/:id` — single project.
- `POST /v1/projects/:id` — update display name + metadata.

### Gotchas
- `projectHooks.postCreate` is where EE creates the associated `ProjectPlan`, sets piece filters, and auto-subscribes an alert receiver (owner email for personal, `context.alertReceiverEmail` for team).
- Soft-deleted projects stay in DB; a background job hard-deletes them.
- Deleting a project removes it from `defaultProjectIds` in the same transaction as the soft delete.
- While personal projects are off, the last default project can't be removed from the list or deleted (`DEFAULT_PROJECT_REQUIRED`, 409). Both checks run with their write under `platformService.runWithNewMemberProjectsLock`, and a platform update only writes `defaultProjectIds` when the request changes it, so a concurrent delete can't be undone by a stale save.
- **SCIM group deletion skips that check on purpose.** `scim-group-service.ts` calls `markForDeletion` directly, so an identity provider can delete the last default project while personal projects are off. Refusing would make the IdP sync fail and retry. With no active default project, `personalProjectsActive` turns personal projects back on for new members; existing members whose only project was the deleted one can be left without a project (ENG-774).
- A saved "off" for personal projects only takes effect while there is an active default project: `newMemberSettingsUtils.personalProjectsActive` keeps them on otherwise, so a platform that turned them off before default projects existed never strands anyone. Read new-member settings through `newMemberSettingsUtils` (`@activepieces/shared`, or `platformHooks.useNewMemberSettings()` in the web), never the raw fields.

### Key files
Entry point: `projectService`, a log-taking factory in `project-service.ts` that every project read and write routes through.

- `packages/server/api/src/app/project/` — core service, TypeORM entity, repo, hooks, worker controller
- `packages/server/api/src/app/ee/projects/` — the whole `/v1/projects` HTTP surface plus members, roles, releases, plans
- `packages/core/shared/src/lib/management/project/` — `Project`, `ProjectPlan`, `ProjectIcon` and request schemas
- `packages/web/src/features/projects/components/` — project switcher, platform switcher, create and edit dialogs
- `packages/web/src/features/projects/stores/` — current-project store

Paths verified 2026-07-17. An earlier version pointed at `project/project-controller.ts`; that file is gone and the `/v1/projects` routes now register from `ee/projects/platform-project-module.ts`.
