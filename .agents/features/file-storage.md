# File Storage Service

## Summary
The File Storage Service is the central infrastructure for persisting binary files in Activepieces. It supports two storage backends: database (PostgreSQL `bytea`) and S3-compatible object storage (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or any S3-compatible endpoint). The backend used for a given file depends on its `FileType` — execution-related files that expire (run logs, step files, trigger payloads, webhook payloads) use the configured `FILE_STORAGE_LOCATION` system property; non-expiring files (platform assets, user profile pictures, knowledge base files, project releases, etc.) always use the database. The one non-expiring exception is `FLOW_BUNDLE` (the prebuilt per-locked-flow-version artifact), which uses the configurable `FILE_STORAGE_LOCATION` so it can be served from S3 even though it never expires. Files are optionally compressed with Zstd. A scheduled system job runs every hour to delete stale execution files beyond the configurable retention window. The `step-file` sub-feature exposes engine-accessible endpoints for pieces to upload and download files produced during a flow run, using short-lived JWT tokens for download authorization.

## Edition Availability
- **Community (CE)**: Fully available — used internally by the execution engine.
- **Enterprise (EE)**: Fully available.
- **Cloud**: Fully available. Cloud typically configures S3 as the storage location for execution files.

## Domain Terms

> Canonical term definitions live in the bounded-context glossaries — see [CONTEXT-MAP.md](../../CONTEXT-MAP.md).

- **FileType**: Categorizes the purpose of a file. Controls storage location (DB vs S3) and retention policy.
- **FileLocation**: `DB` (stored as `bytea` in Postgres) or `S3` (stored in an S3-compatible bucket with the S3 key recorded in the `s3Key` column).
- **FileCompression**: `NONE` or `ZSTD`. Applied to execution data files to reduce storage size. Decompression is transparent on read, including legacy auto-detection via magic bytes.
- **s3Key**: The object key in the S3 bucket. Format: `platform/<platformId>/<type>/<fileId>` for platform-scoped files, or `project/<projectId>/<type>/<fileId>` for project-scoped files.
- **Retention**: Execution data files are deleted after `EXECUTION_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS` days by a periodic cleanup job. Projects can shorten the window via `project.executionDataRetentionDays`; the instance value is the ceiling.
- **Step file**: A file produced by a piece action during execution (e.g., a generated PDF). Uploaded by the engine, downloaded by end users via a signed JWT token.
- **Platform asset**: Public binary (e.g., a platform logo). Always stored in DB; accessed via `/v1/platforms/assets/<fileId>`.
- **Signed URL**: For S3-backed step files when `S3_USE_SIGNED_URLS=true`, the download endpoint redirects to a time-limited pre-signed S3 URL instead of streaming the data through the API server.

## Entity

**file**
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | string | BaseColumnSchemaPart |
| created | timestamp | BaseColumnSchemaPart |
| updated | timestamp | BaseColumnSchemaPart |
| projectId | string (nullable) | ApIdSchema; null for platform-level files |
| platformId | string (nullable) | ApIdSchema |
| data | bytea (nullable) | Binary content for DB-stored files |
| location | string | FileLocation enum (DB or S3) |
| fileName | string (nullable) | Original filename |
| size | number (nullable) | Size in bytes |
| metadata | jsonb (nullable) | Arbitrary key-value string map (e.g., mimetype) |
| s3Key | string (nullable) | S3 object key for S3-stored files |
| type | string | FileType enum (default UNKNOWN) |
| compression | string | FileCompression enum (default NONE) |

Indices: `idx_file_project_id_type_created` on `(projectId, type, created)` for per-project cleanup passes (its leftmost prefix also serves plain `projectId` lookups, replacing the old `idx_file_project_id`); `idx_file_type_created_desc` on `(type, created)` for the global cleanup pass; `idx_file_sample_data_flow_id`, a partial expression index on `(type, (metadata->>'flowId'))` restricted to `SAMPLE_DATA`/`SAMPLE_DATA_INPUT`, so flow-deletion's `deleteForFlow` sample-data purge is index-driven instead of a seq scan that times out.
Relation: many-to-one with `project` (CASCADE on delete, FK `fk_file_project_id`).

## FileType Enum

## Endpoints

### Step File Controller (`/v1/step-files`)

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/signed` | public | Legacy signed download — validates the JWT token, then 302 redirects to `/v1/files/{fileId}?token=...` |

Step file uploads are handled by the engine via the unified `PUT /v1/files/:fileId` endpoint. The legacy `/signed` route remains as a thin redirect so older execution outputs continue to resolve through the canonical `/v1/files/:fileId` path (which handles DB streaming or S3 pre-signed redirect).

## Service Methods

**fileService**
- `save({ fileId?, projectId, platformId?, data, size, type, fileName?, compression, metadata? })` — determines location based on type, saves to DB or S3 (with DB fallback on S3 error). Returns the persisted `File` entity.
- `getFile({ projectId, fileId, type? })` — returns `File | null` (metadata only, no data).
- `getFileOrThrow(params)` — throws ENTITY_NOT_FOUND if not found.
- `getDataOrThrow({ projectId, fileId, type? })` — fetches metadata + binary data. Decompresses transparently. Returns `{ data: Buffer, fileName?, metadata? }`.
- `getDataOrUndefined(params)` — same as `getDataOrThrow` but swallows errors and returns undefined.
- `delete({ projectId, fileId })` — deletes from S3 (if applicable) and DB.
- `deleteStaleBulk(types)` — paginated deletion of expired execution files. Processes up to 4000 files per iteration, deletes S3 keys in batches of 100.
- `uploadPublicAsset({ file, type, platformId, allowedMimeTypes?, maxFileSizeInBytes?, metadata? })` — validates MIME type and file size, saves, returns the public URL (`<FRONTEND_URL>/api/v1/platforms/assets/<fileId>`).

**s3Helper**
- `constructS3Key(platformId, projectId, type, fileId)` — builds deterministic S3 key.
- `uploadFile(s3Key, data)` — PutObject to S3 (known-length Buffer).
- `uploadStream(s3Key, body)` — streams a `Readable` to S3 via `@aws-sdk/lib-storage` `Upload` (unknown length, ~5MB parts); returns the byte count from `httpUploadProgress`.
- `getFile(s3Key)` — GetObject from S3, returns Buffer.
- `getS3SignedUrl(s3Key, fileName)` — generates a 7-day pre-signed GET URL.
- `putS3SignedUrl({ s3Key, contentLength, contentEncoding })` — generates a 7-day pre-signed PUT URL.
- `deleteFiles(s3Keys)` — DeleteObjects in batches of 100 (Cloudflare R2 limit); sends the CRC32C checksum algorithm (OCI Object Storage rejects the SDK-default CRC32).
- `validateS3Configuration()` — smoke test: puts, heads, and deletes a test object.

## Cleanup Job

Scheduled every hour (`30 */1 * * *`) via `SystemJobName.FILE_CLEANUP_TRIGGER`. Calls `fileService.deleteStaleBulk` for types: `FLOW_RUN_LOG`, `FLOW_RUN_LOG_SLICE`, `ACTION_RUN_LOG`, `FLOW_STEP_FILE`, `TRIGGER_EVENT_FILE`, `TRIGGER_PAYLOAD`, `WEBHOOK_PAYLOAD`, then `actionRunService.deleteStale()` to delete the stale `action_run` rows themselves (the offloaded `ACTION_RUN_LOG` file is removed by the bulk pass above; the row is removed here). Retention period controlled by the `EXECUTION_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS` system property, overridable per project (shorter only) via `project.executionDataRetentionDays` ([projects.md](./projects.md)). Because the instance value is a hard ceiling, the global pass needs no project exclusions: any row older than the instance boundary is deletable regardless of overrides, so the performance-critical `(type, created)` query keeps its original shape on `idx_file_type_created_desc`. Overrides below the ceiling get one extra pass per **distinct** effective retention value (not per project), filtered by `projectId IN (...)` and served by `idx_file_project_id_type_created`. The effective value comes from `getEffectiveExecutionDataRetentionDays`, which clamps stored overrides into `[PAUSED_FLOW_TIMEOUT_DAYS, EXECUTION_DATA_RETENTION_DAYS]` at cleanup time, so later env changes can never delete data a still-paused run needs or extend retention past the instance policy. Override passes run before the global pass so a large instance-wide backlog cannot starve them out of the shared per-run deletion cap. The flow-run retry window (`flow-run-service.ts` retry) uses the same effective value, keeping the `FLOW_RUN_RETRY_OUTSIDE_RETENTION` guard aligned with when files are actually deleted.

## Streaming — write path (implemented)

`ctx.files.write()` accepts a `Readable` as well as a `Buffer`, so a piece can write a file it never fully holds in RAM. See [ADR-0007](../../docs/adr/0007-streaming-files-use-presigned-multipart-not-app-relay.md).

- **Piece API:** `FilesService.write({ fileName, data: Buffer | Readable })` (`@activepieces/pieces-framework` ≥ 0.34.0). A `Buffer` keeps the exact existing behaviour; a `Readable` streams.
- **Transport — one path.** For a stream the engine (`engineFileApi.upload`) PUTs to `POST-less` `PUT /v1/files/:fileId` with **no `Content-Length`** (chunked, `duplex:'half'`, no retry — a stream can't replay). The app detects the stream by the **absence of `Content-Length`**, skips the presigned-redirect branch, and streams the body to storage:
  - S3 → `s3Helper.uploadStream()` (`@aws-sdk/lib-storage` `Upload`, ~5 MB parts, bounded memory; size read from `httpUploadProgress`).
  - DB → buffered into `bytea` (a stream can't stream into a column).
- **Known-length `Buffer` writes are unchanged** — same `uploadFile` / `S3_USE_SIGNED_URLS` presigned-redirect paths.
- **Size guard:** `filesController` streams the request through an `enforceByteLimit` transform (→ `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`), since a stream's length is unknown upfront.
- **Content-type parser:** `filesController` replaces the global buffering `application/octet-stream` parser with an encapsulated passthrough (raw stream) so the PUT body isn't buffered — scoped to this plugin; other octet-stream consumers are untouched.
- **New dependency:** `@aws-sdk/lib-storage`.

### Deferred (not built)
- **Property.file streaming (read side)** — a piece supplies its own `Readable`; a dedicated streaming file-input mode was judged YAGNI.
- **Presigned multipart** (bytes off the app on `S3_USE_SIGNED_URLS`) — rejected as over-engineering; see ADR-0007.

### Webhook streaming ingestion (implemented)
Reuses `s3Helper.uploadStream` + `fileService.save({ data: Readable })` to stream inbound webhook files (multipart + raw-binary) to S3 without buffering. `@fastify/multipart`'s global `attachFieldsToBody` is gone, so every multipart consumer opts in explicitly — the webhook streams via `request.parts()`, `users` buffers via `request.file()`, and the routes whose schemas expect `ApMultipartFile` (piece install CE + EE, platform logos, knowledge-base upload) attach the per-route `attachMultipartFieldsToBody` hook. `rawBody` capture moved into a scoped `preParsing` hook (streamed types forgo `rawBody`). See the Webhooks feature doc for the full decision list and [ADR-0008](../../docs/adr/0008-webhook-files-stream-via-explicit-multipart-consumption.md).
