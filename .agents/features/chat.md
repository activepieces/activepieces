# Chat Module

## Summary
A platform-level AI chat assistant that lets users interact with an LLM to manage their Activepieces projects through natural language. The chat connects to the platform's configured AI provider, streams responses via the Vercel AI SDK, and exposes Activepieces resources (flows, tables, connections, runs) as callable tools through the project's MCP server. Conversations are persisted per-user with support for message compaction, file attachments, multi-project context switching, plan approval for multi-step operations, and a tool approval gate for destructive operations.

## Edition Availability
- Community (CE): not available (module not registered)
- Enterprise (EE): available when `platform.plan.chatEnabled` is true
- Cloud: available when `platform.plan.chatEnabled` is true

## Domain Terms
- **ChatConversation** — a persisted conversation between a user and the AI assistant, scoped to a platform and user; optionally scoped to a project for tool access
- **Message compaction** — when a conversation exceeds a token threshold, older messages are summarized by the LLM and replaced with a summary to keep context within the model's window
- **Tool approval gate** — a Redis pub/sub mechanism that pauses destructive tool executions (delete, test, publish) until the user explicitly approves or denies in the UI; times out after 5 minutes
- **Plan approval** — a multi-step approval mechanism where the agent presents a plan via `ap_request_plan_approval`, the user approves or rejects, and approved plans execute with progress tracking
- **Local tools** — chat-specific tools not part of MCP: `ap_set_session_title`, `ap_select_project`, `ap_run_one_time_action`, `ap_list_across_projects`, `ap_request_plan_approval`
- **Display tools** — tools that render interactive UI cards: `ap_show_connection_required`, `ap_show_connection_picker`, `ap_show_project_picker`, `ap_show_questions`, `ap_show_quick_replies`
- **MCP tools** — project-scoped tools loaded from the Activepieces MCP server when a project is selected; destructive ones are wrapped with the approval gate
- **AI provider** — a platform-configured LLM provider with an `enabledForChat` flag; the chat resolves the first enabled provider and its default model
- **Project context** — the currently selected project for a conversation; determines which MCP tools are available and scopes resource access
- **Chat tiers** — model configurations (fast/smart/premium) with different thinking budgets; displayed as Fast/Expert/Heavy in the UI with per-tier descriptions

## Data Model

**ChatConversation**: id, platformId, userId, projectId (nullable), title (nullable), modelName (nullable), messages (JSONB array of `ModelMessage`), summary (text, nullable — compaction summary), summarizedUpToIndex (int, nullable — index up to which messages are summarized).
- Relations: platform (many-to-one), project (many-to-one, SET NULL on delete), user (many-to-one, CASCADE on delete)
- Index: `idx_chat_conversation_platform_user_created_id` on (platformId, userId, created, id)

## Key Service Methods
- `createConversation()` — creates a new conversation for a user on a platform
- `listConversations()` — cursor-paginated list of user's conversations, ordered by creation date descending
- `getConversationOrThrow()` — fetches a conversation, enforcing ownership (platformId + userId)
- `updateConversation()` — updates title and/or modelName
- `deleteConversation()` — deletes a conversation after ownership check
- `getMessages()` — reconstructs `ChatHistoryMessage[]` from stored `ModelMessage[]`
- `sendMessage()` — the main streaming flow: resolves provider, connects MCP, builds prompt, runs `streamText()` with `prepareStep`; persists assistant response on completion

## Local Tools
- `ap_set_session_title` — auto-names the conversation after the first exchange
- `ap_select_project` — switches project context (scopes MCP tools to that project)
- `ap_run_one_time_action` — executes a single piece action ad-hoc (e.g. "check my inbox"); auto-discovers connections across projects
- `ap_list_across_projects` — lists flows, tables, runs, or connections across all user-accessible projects
- `ap_request_plan_approval` — presents a multi-step plan to the user for approval before executing destructive or write operations

## Display Tools
- `ap_show_connection_required` — prompts the user to connect a service
- `ap_show_connection_picker` — lets the user choose between multiple connections
- `ap_show_project_picker` — lets the user select a project
- `ap_show_questions` — renders an interactive multi-question form
- `ap_show_quick_replies` — shows suggested response buttons

## Endpoints
- `POST /v1/chat/conversations` — create conversation
- `GET /v1/chat/conversations` — list conversations (cursor, limit)
- `GET /v1/chat/conversations/:id` — get conversation
- `POST /v1/chat/conversations/:id` — update conversation (title, modelName)
- `DELETE /v1/chat/conversations/:id` — delete conversation
- `GET /v1/chat/conversations/:id/messages` — get conversation messages
- `POST /v1/chat/conversations/:id/messages` — send message (streaming response)
- `POST /v1/chat/tool-approvals/:gateId` — approve or deny a tool execution

All endpoints require `PrincipalType.USER` authentication at the platform level.

## Message Flow
1. User sends message via `POST /conversations/:id/messages`
2. Service resolves AI provider, connects MCP client, builds system prompt with project list
3. If conversation is long, compaction summarizes older messages
4. `streamText()` streams the LLM response with local tools + display tools + MCP tools available
5. Destructive MCP tool calls pause and emit an approval request to the UI via the stream
6. User approves/denies via `POST /tool-approvals/:gateId`, unblocking the gate via Redis pub/sub
7. On stream completion, assistant messages are appended to the stored conversation
