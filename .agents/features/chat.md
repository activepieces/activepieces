# Chat Module

## Summary
A platform-level AI chat assistant that lets users interact with an LLM to manage their Activepieces projects through natural language. The chat connects to the platform's configured AI provider, streams responses via a custom WebSocket chunk reducer, and exposes Activepieces resources (flows, tables, connections, runs) as callable tools through the project's MCP server. Conversations are persisted per-user with support for message compaction, file attachments, multi-project context switching, a unified setup form for collecting automation inputs, cross-conversation user memory, two-phase (discovery/build) tool gating, and a tool approval gate for destructive operations.

## Domain Terms
- **ChatConversation** — a persisted conversation between a user and the AI assistant, scoped to a platform and user; optionally scoped to a project for tool access
- **Message compaction** — when a conversation exceeds a token threshold, older messages are summarized by the LLM and replaced with a summary to keep context within the model's window
- **Tool approval gate** — a Redis pub/sub mechanism that pauses destructive tool executions (delete, test, publish) until the user explicitly approves or denies in the UI; times out after 5 minutes
- **Setup form** — the unified input-collection surface (replaces the old plan-approval flow). After discovery, the agent renders one `ap_show_setup_form` card with the minimal required fields; submitting the form is the user's approval and the build executes directly. Field options are resolved server-side via the `resolve-options` endpoint
- **DiscoveryBrief** — agent-curated JSONB on `ChatConversation` capturing the user's goal (what/why/constraints/dataFindings); injected into the system prompt via `{{DISCOVERY_BRIEF}}` and used as the internal plan. Updated only by the agent through `ap_update_brief` (never auto-derived from tool results)
- **UserChatMemory** — durable, platform+user-scoped preferences/corrections (e.g. "default notify = Slack") captured by the agent via `ap_remember` and injected into the prompt via `{{USER_MEMORY}}`; strictly never cross-tenant
- **Two-phase toolset gating** — the agent runs in a `discovery` or `build` phase (`tool-phases.ts`); a denylist hides build-only tools during discovery to shrink the tool surface. `ap_set_phase` flips the phase; the gate auto-widens if a build/manage tool fires so the agent can't get stuck
- **Local tools** — chat-specific tools not part of MCP: `ap_set_session_title`, `ap_select_project`, `ap_deselect_project`, `ap_execute_action`, `ap_list_across_projects`, `ap_explore_data`, `ap_update_brief`, `ap_remember`, `ap_load_guide`, `ap_set_phase`
- **Display tools** — tools that render interactive UI cards: `ap_show_connection_required`, `ap_show_connection_picker`, `ap_show_project_picker`, `ap_show_questions`, `ap_show_quick_replies`
- **MCP tools** — project-scoped tools loaded from the Activepieces MCP server when a project is selected; destructive ones are wrapped with the approval gate
- **Tool call UX metadata** — optional `title` (2-4 word chip label) and `description` (first-person conversational sentence) stored on `PersistedToolCallPart`; description is sourced from the preceding `ap_update_thinking_status` text with `input.description` as fallback, rendered above the tool card chip
- **Server-managed connections** — connection externalIds are never exposed to the LLM; `ap_discover_action_auth` stores available connections in Redis (with `grantedScopes` and `requiredScopes` for scope-aware selection), `ap_show_connection_picker` stores the user's selection, and `ap_execute_action` auto-fills the connection from the store
- **Action preview gate** — write/destructive actions show a preview card (parameters, connection) before execution; classification uses a hybrid AI-driven (`needsConfirmation` flag) + server hard-floor (name pattern matching) approach; persisted as pending gate in Redis for refresh resilience
- **Action receipt** — server-rendered card showing action result (status, output, connection badge, timestamp); emitted as `ACTION_RECEIPT` event and persisted as `PersistedChatPartType.ACTION_RECEIPT` in conversation history; receipt cards visually split the thinking accordion so each action's thinking section appears immediately above its receipt card
- **Pending gate persistence** — when a display tool or action preview blocks on approval, gate metadata is stored in Redis so the frontend can re-show the card after page refresh; cleared automatically when the gate resolves
- **Stream reconnection** — when loading a STREAMING conversation (e.g. after refresh), the frontend extracts the last assistant message from history as the streaming message's initial content, calls `getPendingGate` to inject synthetic display-tool parts for pending gates, then calls `startStream`; a socket `connect` handler re-registers the chunk listener and resets the stale-check timer on reconnect; the periodic stale-check calls `GET /conversations/:id` and only reconciles when the server's status is no longer STREAMING, so long tool executions (>15s) are not incorrectly torn down
- **Run ID event filtering** — each agent run gets a unique `runId` (generated in the controller, included in job data, threaded through all websocket events); the frontend's event handler filters by `runId` to prevent stale FINISHED/ERROR events from old runs from killing new streams; combined with a generation counter that guards against stale async reconcile callbacks
- **AI provider** — a platform-configured LLM provider with an `enabledForChat` flag; the chat resolves the first enabled provider and its default model
- **Streaming cancel** — cancel keys are run-scoped (`chat-cancel:{conversationId}:{runId}`) so each worker only checks its own key; a 3-second periodic timer polls the Redis key so cancellation fires within 3 seconds regardless of step boundaries; partial messages (from completed steps via `onAbort` callback) are saved to preserve context for resume; when a new message arrives while STREAMING, the controller reads the active runId, cancels that specific run, and resets status to IDLE before queuing the new job
- **Stale recovery** — when `getConversationOrThrow` fetches a conversation stuck in STREAMING for more than 2 minutes, it automatically resets the status to IDLE before returning
- **Project context** — the currently selected project for a conversation; determines which MCP tools are available and scopes resource access
- **Chat tiers** — model configurations (fast/smart/premium) with different thinking budgets; displayed as Fast/Expert/Heavy in the UI with per-tier descriptions
- **Credits warning banner** — a dismissible amber banner shown when Activepieces AI credits usage reaches 70%; a non-dismissible red banner is shown when credits are fully exhausted

## Data Model

**ChatConversation**: id, platformId, userId, projectId (nullable), title (nullable), modelName (nullable), messages (JSONB array of `ModelMessage`), summary (text, nullable — compaction summary), summarizedUpToIndex (int, nullable — index up to which messages are summarized), discoveryBrief (JSONB, nullable — agent-curated goal/constraints).
- Relations: platform (many-to-one), project (many-to-one, SET NULL on delete), user (many-to-one, CASCADE on delete)
- Index: `idx_chat_conversation_platform_user_created_id` on (platformId, userId, created, id)

**UserChatMemory**: id, platformId, userId, memories (JSONB array of strings — durable preferences, capped at 50 entries / 280 chars each).
- Relations: platform (many-to-one, CASCADE on delete), user (many-to-one, CASCADE on delete)
- Index: unique `idx_user_chat_memory_platform_user` on (platformId, userId)
- Writes go through `rememberForUser`, which serializes concurrent updates with a transaction + pessimistic row lock so the read-modify-write of `memories` can't lose entries

## Key Service Methods
- `createConversation()` — creates a new conversation for a user on a platform
- `listConversations()` — cursor-paginated list of user's conversations, ordered by creation date descending; excludes messages, uiMessages, and summary columns for performance
- `getConversationOrThrow()` — fetches a conversation, enforcing ownership (platformId + userId); auto-recovers stale STREAMING conversations to IDLE after a 2-minute timeout
- `updateConversation()` — updates title and/or modelName
- `deleteConversation()` — deletes a conversation after ownership check; blocked while status is STREAMING
- `getMessages()` — reconstructs `ChatHistoryMessage[]` from stored `ModelMessage[]`
- `sendMessage()` — the main streaming flow: resolves provider, connects MCP, builds prompt, runs `streamText()` with `stopWhen: isLoopFinished()` (no hard step cap), `prepareStep` (hides plan approval tool after approval), `experimental_repairToolCall` (auto-fixes malformed JSON), and `experimental_onToolCallFinish` (per-tool logging); retries event delivery with exponential backoff; tools have a 5-minute per-call timeout with AbortSignal propagation; persists assistant response on completion

## Local Tools
- `ap_set_session_title` — auto-names the conversation after the first exchange
- `ap_select_project` — switches project context (scopes MCP tools to that project)
- `ap_execute_action` — executes a single piece action ad-hoc (e.g. "check my inbox"); connections are managed server-side (the LLM never sees externalIds); write/destructive actions trigger an action preview gate before execution; emits `ACTION_RECEIPT` events after completion
- `ap_list_across_projects` — lists flows, tables, runs, or connections across all user-accessible projects
- `ap_deselect_project` — clears the selected project context
- `ap_explore_data` — read-only exploration of the user's data (sheets, channels, columns) to build understanding during discovery; never configures the automation
- `ap_update_brief` — silently updates the conversation's `DiscoveryBrief` (agent-controlled)
- `ap_remember` — silently persists a durable user preference/correction to `UserChatMemory`
- `ap_load_guide` — loads an on-demand prompt guide (e.g. `build_flow`) so guidance is only in context when needed
- `ap_set_phase` — flips the agent between the `discovery` and `build` tool phases

## Display Tools
- `ap_show_connection_required` — prompts the user to connect a service
- `ap_show_connection_picker` — lets the user choose between multiple connections; no longer receives connections array from LLM (server-managed); returns only `{ selected: true, label }` to LLM, stripping externalIds
- `ap_show_project_picker` — lets the user select a project
- `ap_show_questions` — renders an interactive multi-question form
- `ap_show_quick_replies` — shows suggested response buttons
- `ap_show_setup_form` — renders the unified setup form (sections per piece, project as a first-class step); submission triggers the build directly

## Endpoints
- `POST /v1/chat/conversations` — create conversation
- `GET /v1/chat/conversations` — list conversations (cursor, limit)
- `GET /v1/chat/conversations/:id` — get conversation
- `POST /v1/chat/conversations/:id` — update conversation (title, modelName)
- `DELETE /v1/chat/conversations/:id` — delete conversation
- `GET /v1/chat/conversations/:id/messages` — get conversation messages
- `POST /v1/chat/conversations/:id/messages` — send message; if the conversation is STREAMING the old run is cancelled; response body is `{ conversationId, runId }` — clients use runId to filter stale events
- `POST /v1/chat/tool-approvals/:gateId` — approve or deny a tool execution
- `POST /v1/chat/conversations/:id/cancel` — cancel an in-progress streaming response
- `GET /v1/chat/conversations/:id/connections?pieceName=` — get available connections for connection picker; falls back to `findConnectionsForPiece` when the Redis cache is empty and stores the result for future calls
- `GET /v1/chat/conversations/:id/pending-gate` — get pending approval gate for refresh resilience (returns gate info so the frontend can re-show display tool cards)
- `POST /v1/chat/conversations/:id/resolve-options` — resolves setup-form field options (pieces, connections, property dropdowns) for the given project; enforces project access before resolving

- `POST /v1/admin/chat/sync-all` — bulk historical sync of all conversations to console analytics (admin API key required)

All chat endpoints require `PrincipalType.USER` authentication at the platform level. The admin sync endpoint uses `api-key` header auth.

## Message Flow
1. User sends message via `POST /conversations/:id/messages`
1a. If the conversation is STREAMING, the controller reads the active runId, cancels that run, and resets status to IDLE
1b. If the platform's chat provider is ACTIVEPIECES and `usageRemaining <= 0`, the endpoint returns a 402 `AI_CREDIT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` error before queuing the job; the frontend surfaces a non-dismissible error banner
1c. Controller generates a `runId`, includes it in the job data, and returns it to the frontend
2. Service resolves AI provider, connects MCP client, builds system prompt with project list
3. If conversation is long, compaction summarizes older messages
4. `streamText()` streams the LLM response with local tools + display tools + MCP tools available
5. Destructive MCP tool calls pause and emit an approval request to the UI via the stream
6. User approves/denies via `POST /tool-approvals/:gateId`, unblocking the gate via Redis pub/sub
7. On stream completion, assistant messages are appended to the stored conversation
8. On cloud, `chatAnalyticsTelemetry` pushes the updated conversation to `console.activepieces.com` for monitoring (fire-and-forget, skipped when `CONSOLE_API_SECRET_KEY` is unset); messages are sourced from uiMessages when available, falling back to reconstruction from raw ModelMessage[] for older conversations
