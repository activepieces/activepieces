# Flows Module

## Summary
Flows are the core automation primitive in Activepieces. Each flow is a versioned directed graph of trigger and action steps stored as a JSONB tree. The module handles the full lifecycle: draft editing via a single-endpoint operation dispatch, publishing (locking a version and registering the trigger source), enabling/disabling, folder organization, sample data capture for testing, human-input forms/chat interfaces, and the visual builder frontend powered by XYFlow. All 26 flow modification types are dispatched through one endpoint (`POST /v1/flows/:id`) with a discriminated-union body.

## Edition Availability
- **Community (CE)**: Full flow authoring, publishing, folders, sample data, human-input forms.
- **Enterprise (EE) / Cloud**: Same core. Some operational features (owner transfer, piece filtering, template sharing) integrate with EE plan flags. Active-flow quota enforcement on publish/enable.

## Domain Terms
- **Flow**: The persistent automation record — holds status, folder, published version pointer, and metadata.
- **FlowVersion**: An immutable (once locked) snapshot of the trigger + action graph. DRAFT state is editable; LOCKED state is the published baseline.
- **FlowOperationRequest**: The discriminated union of all 26 modification types dispatched to `POST /v1/flows/:id`.
- **Draft / Published split**: Editing always happens on the DRAFT version. `LOCK_AND_PUBLISH` snapshots it to LOCKED and optionally enables the flow.
- **Trigger Source**: The external registration (webhook URL, polling schedule, app-event subscription) that fires the flow. Registered on enable, unregistered on disable.
- **externalId**: A stable UUID used to cross-reference a flow across imports/templates (preserved through `IMPORT_FLOW` operations).
- **Folder**: A simple grouping container for flows and tables within a project.
- **Sample Data**: Captured step output (input + output) stored as File entities per flow version, used for testing downstream steps without live execution.
- **Human Input**: Flows that expose a public form (`/form/:flowId`) or chat interface (`/chat/:flowId`) as their trigger UI.
- **operationStatus**: Tracks in-progress mutations (ENABLING, DISABLING, DELETING) to prevent race conditions on concurrent state changes.
- **createdBy**: Records the automated source that created the flow as a discriminated union (`FlowCreator`: `{ type: 'MCP' | 'AGENT', id }`). Null for human-created flows. Server-set only — surfaced in the UI as the "AI" badge (`FlowCreatedByBadge`). Distinct from `ownerId`, which is the current owning user.

## Entities

**Flow**: id, projectId, folderId (nullable), status (ENABLED/DISABLED), externalId, publishedVersionId (nullable, unique FK), metadata (JSONB), operationStatus (NONE/DELETING/ENABLING/DISABLING), timeSavedPerRun, ownerId, templateId, createdBy (nullable JSONB — `FlowCreator`). Relations: project, folder, owner, publishedVersion (one-to-one), versions (one-to-many), runs, events, tableWebhooks.

**FlowVersion**: id, flowId, displayName, schemaVersion, trigger (JSONB — full flow graph), connectionIds[], agentIds[], updatedBy, valid, state (DRAFT/LOCKED), backupFiles (JSONB), notes[] (JSONB). Relations: flow, updatedByUser.

**Folder**: id, projectId, displayName. Used to organize flows and tables. Case-insensitive uniqueness.

## Flow Operations (Single-Endpoint Dispatch)

All flow modifications go through `POST /v1/flows/:id` with a `FlowOperationRequest` discriminated union. **26 operation types**:

- Structure: ADD_ACTION, UPDATE_ACTION, DELETE_ACTION, DUPLICATE_ACTION, MOVE_ACTION, SET_SKIP_ACTION
- Branching: ADD_BRANCH, DELETE_BRANCH, DUPLICATE_BRANCH, MOVE_BRANCH
- Trigger: UPDATE_TRIGGER
- Publishing: LOCK_AND_PUBLISH, USE_AS_DRAFT, LOCK_FLOW, CHANGE_STATUS
- Organization: CHANGE_FOLDER, CHANGE_NAME, UPDATE_OWNER, UPDATE_METADATA, IMPORT_FLOW
- Data: SAVE_SAMPLE_DATA, UPDATE_SAMPLE_DATA_INFO, UPDATE_MINUTES_SAVED
- Notes: ADD_NOTE, UPDATE_NOTE, DELETE_NOTE

## Draft vs Published

- New flow → FlowVersion in DRAFT state (editable)
- LOCK_AND_PUBLISH → creates LOCKED version (immutable), sets `flow.publishedVersionId`
- USE_AS_DRAFT → copies published version back to draft for editing
- Only published flows can be enabled (triggers registered)

## Publishing Side Effects

When LOCK_AND_PUBLISH or CHANGE_STATUS to ENABLED:
1. Lock version → set publishedVersionId
2. Enable trigger source (register webhook/polling/app-event)
3. Invalidate flow execution cache
4. Emit WebSocket event
5. Track telemetry

When CHANGE_STATUS to DISABLED:
1. Disable trigger source (unregister webhook/polling)
2. Invalidate cache

## Human Input (`human-input/`)

- **Form controller** (`GET /form/:flowId`): Public endpoint returning form UI config from flow definition. Supports `?useDraft=true`.
- **Chat controller** (`GET /chat/:flowId`): Public endpoint returning chat UI config. Supports sessionId, message, file attachments.

## Step-Run / Sample Data (`step-run/`)

- Captures test data per step (input + output)
- Stored as File entities (SAMPLE_DATA / SAMPLE_DATA_INPUT types)
- Per flow version — each version has its own test data

## Frontend Builder Architecture

The visual builder (`packages/web/src/app/builder/`) uses XYFlow for the canvas. State is split into focused Zustand slices, composed by `builder-state-provider.tsx`:
- `flow-state.ts` — current flow and version, pending operations
- `run-state.ts` — active test run, step results, focused/failed step (used by the run-info widget's "See error" affordance); `setRun` resets `userManuallySelectedStepDuringRun` whenever a new run id arrives
- `canvas-state.ts` — viewport, selected node, drag state, plus the `userManuallySelectedStepDuringRun` flag and `resumeLiveFollow` action that gate auto-follow. The auto-focus effect lives in `useFocusOnStep` (`flow-canvas/hooks.tsx`): it calls `selectStepByName(step, { fromAutoFocus: true })` to pan the canvas to the latest engine step, and short-circuits whenever `userManuallySelectedStepDuringRun` is set. The flag flips to `true` when the user picks a different step mid-run (any `selectStepByName` call without `fromAutoFocus`) and clears via `resumeLiveFollow` or when `setRun` receives a new run id. Also owns the step-data-panel layout state: `stepDataPanelView` (`StepDataPanelView` = `'split' | 'drawer'`, persisted via localStorage) and `isStepDataPanelOpen`
- `step-form-state.ts` — open/focused step configuration
- `piece-selector-state.ts` — piece browser visibility and search
- `notes-state.tsx` — sticky notes overlay
- `chat-state.ts` — embedded chat drawer state for testing `chat_submission`-trigger flows from the builder

`flowHooks.useChangeFlowStatus` handles both publish and enable/disable, surfaces `TRIGGER_UPDATE_STATUS` errors via an `ApErrorDialog`, and maps gateway timeout errors to a user-readable message. `flowHooks.importFlowsFromTemplates` replaces `externalId` references across a multi-flow template import to maintain cross-flow links.

## Step Data Panel (Builder)

The step-settings sidebar hosts a step data panel with two layouts, switched via `stepDataPanelView` in canvas state:
- **`drawer`** — slides up from the bottom of the sidebar, occupies 60% height, sits at `z-50` over the settings form. Dismisses on outside-click (pointerdown listener in `step-data/step-data-panel-host.tsx`, ignoring Radix poppers, role="dialog", and resizable handles).
- **`split`** — non-resizable 50/50 horizontal split between settings form and step data panel inside the sidebar.

`step-settings/index.tsx` composes the two layouts via `StepSettingsLayout`, rendering `StepDataPanelHost` for the active view. The bottom CTA (`TestStepCTAButton`) shows under the settings form when the drawer is closed; clicking it opens the drawer and auto-fires the test by calling `useActionTestRunner().fireTest()` or `useTriggerTestRunner().fireTest()` from context. `ActionTestRunnerProvider` owns the action mutation and the return-response webhook dialog; `TriggerTestRunnerProvider` owns the trigger piece lookup, the three trigger mutations (`simulate`, `poll`, `saveMock`), the MCP-tool testing dialog, and a `fireTest()` dispatcher that picks the right one based on `triggerEventUtils.getTestType`. Both providers are wired with the Zustand-backed `selectedStep` (not the RHF form values) so `step.valid` stays in sync with the resolver-computed validity that `applyOperation` writes to canvas state — RHF never writes the resolver's `valid` back into its own form store, so reading from `form.getValues()` / `form.formState.isValid` would observe a stale value for freshly-added steps.

`builder/index.tsx` drives the right-sidebar pixel size imperatively: a `useLayoutEffect` on `react-resizable-panels`' `PanelImperativeHandle.resize()` targets `1000px` (initial split open), `850px` (subsequent split open), or `25%` (drawer). A separate `useEffect` attaches a `ResizeObserver` while the user drags the handle and auto-collapses split → drawer once the sidebar drops under `700px`. The old `useAnimateSidebar` hook has been removed in favour of this approach.
